            "4ab39729-af77-46f7-a662-16984fb9c1db We studied an autoassociative neural network with dynamic synapses which include a facilitating mechanism. We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.\n",
            "4ab5e3f4-9b58-4fbb-9bde-ee2f2185cc61 In this paper, a weighting-delay-based method is developed for the study of the stability problem of a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with time-varying delay. Different from previous results, the delay interval [0, d(t)] is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.\n",

            "4ab7fd62-8f72-4845-a1fb-77e2d9c2a733 An intelligent control stand-alone doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system using proportional-integral-derivative neural network (PIDNN) is proposed in this study. This system can be applied as a stand-alone power supply system or as the emergency power system when the electricity grid fails for all sub-synchronous, synchronous and super-synchronous conditions. The rotor side converter is controlled using the field-oriented control to produce three-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and on-line learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.\n",
            "4abb4018-46f7-4e6f-95e5-11a1e8ac1a1f One important issue in designing medical knowledge-based systems is the management of uncertainty. Among the schemes that have been developed for this purpose, probability and CF (certainty factor) are the most widely used. If rules are organized according to a connectionist model, then neural network learning suggests a promising solution to this problem. When most rules are correct, semantically incorrect rules can be recognized if their associated certainty factors are weakened or change signs after training with correct samples. The techniques for rule base refinement are examined under this approach. The concept has been implemented and tested in an actual medical expert system. >\n",
            "4abeecb8-6904-4314-bb64-9980d8bf893c Motivation: The prediction of localization sites of various proteins is an important and challenging problem in the field of molecular biology. TargetP, by Emanuelsson et al. (J. Mol. Biol., 300, 1005‐1016, 2000) is a neural network based system which is currently the best predictor in the literature for N-terminal sorting signals. One drawback of neural networks, however, is that it is generally difficult to understand and interpret how and why they make such predictions. In this paper, we aim to generate simple and interpretable rules as predictors, and still achieve a practical prediction accuracy. We adopt an approach which consists of an extensive search for simple rules and various attributes which is partially guided by human intuition. Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose prediction accuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining a very simple and interpretable form. We also discuss and interpret the discovered rules. Availability: An (experimental) web service using rules obtained by our method is provided at http:\n",
            "4ac35d9e-d904-4af9-ae7b-602863c771f1 Large-scale traffic networks can be modeled as graphs in which a set of nodes are connected through a set of links that cannot be loaded above their traffic capacities. Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. In this case, a dynamic routing problem arises. The decision makers are realistically assumed 1) to generate their routing decisions on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from other nodes, typically, the neighboring ones and 2) to cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal, that is, the minimization of the total traffic cost. Therefore, they can be regarded as the cooperating members of informationally distributed organizations, which, in control engineering and economics, are called team organizations. Team optimal control problems cannot be solved analytically unless special assumptions on the team model are verified. In general, this is not the case with traffic networks. An approximate resolutive method is then proposed, in which each decision maker is assigned a fixed-structure routing function where some parameters have to be optimized. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feedforward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The routing functions can also be computed (or adapted) locally at each node. Concerning traffic networks, we focus attention on store-and-forward packet switching networks, which exhibit the essential peculiarities and difficulties of other traffic networks. Simulations performed on complex communication networks point out the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",
            "4ac51b4a-4af7-4c6d-a9fd-eb216a9941ed An integration of a fuzzy controller and modified Elman neural networks (NN) approximation-based computed-torque controller is proposed for motion control of autonomous manipulators in dynamic and partially known environments containing moving obstacles. The navigation technique of robot control using artificial potential fields is based on the fuzzy controller. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and or unstructured unmodeled dynamics of the robot arm. The NN weights are tuned online, with no off-line learning phase required. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. The purpose of the controller, which is designed as a neuro-fuzzy controller, is to generate the commands for the servo-systems of the robot so it may choose its way to its goal autonomously, while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. The proposed scheme has been successfully tested. The controller also demonstrates remarkable performance in adaptation to changes in manipulator dynamics. Sensor-based motion control is an essential feature for dealing with model uncertainties and unexpected obstacles in real-time world systems.\n",

There are many approaches in literature that try to solve this hitherto rather ill-defined task. In the present study, we propose a most general generative model of binary data for Boolean factor analysis and introduce new Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithm which maximizes likelihood of Boolean Factor Analysis solution. Using the so-called bars problem benchmark, we compare efficiencies of Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithm with Dendritic Inhibition neural network. Then we discuss advantages and disadvantages of both approaches as regards results quality and methods efficiency.\n",

Here we will show that a dynamic neural network outperforms the conventional approach. When the artificial neural network (ANN) is trained with supervised learning schemes there is a need to supply the desired signal for all time, although we are only interested in detecting the transient. In this paper we also show the effects on the detection agreement of different strategies to construct the desired signal. The extension of the Bayes decision rule (0/1 desired signal), optimal in static classification, performs worse than desired signals constructed by random noise or prediction during the background.\n",

Single- layer and multilayer perceptron networks are used in a study on perceptron topologies and training procedures for pattern classifica- tion of breast masses. The contours of a set of 111 regions on mam- mograms related to breast masses and tumors are manually delin- eated and represented by polygonal models for shape analysis. Ribbons of pixels are extracted around the boundaries of a subset of 57 masses by dilating and eroding the contours. Three shape fac- tors, three measures of edge sharpness, and 14 texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices of the pixels in the rib- bons are computed. Several combinations of the features are used with perceptrons of varying topology and training procedures for the classification of benign masses and malignant tumors. The results are compared in terms of the area Az under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Values of Az up to 0.99 are obtained with the shape factors and texture features. However, only feature sets that included at least one shape factor provide consistently high perfor- mance with respect to variations in network topology and training.\n",

This is especially true in the field of urban railway transport where video-based surveillance can be exploited to face many relevant security aspects (e.g. vandalism, overcrowding, abandoned object detection etc.). This paper aims at investigating an open problem in the implementation of video-based surveillance systems for transport applications, i.e., the implementation of reliable image understanding modules in order to recognize dangerous situations with reduced false alarm and misdetection rates. We considered the use of a neural network-based classifier for detecting vandal behavior in metro stations. The achieved results show that the classifier achieves very good performance even in the presence of high scene complexity.\n",

Pseudo-imaging, which involves the automatic localization, spectrum estimation, and identification of energetic sources, can be difficult for dim sources and/or noisy images, or in data containing multiple sources which are closely spaced such that their signatures overlap. The new approach is specifically designed for these difficult cases. It is developed within the framework of modeling field theory (MFT), a biologically-inspired neural network system that has demonstrated practical value in many diverse areas. MFT performs an efficient optimization over the space of all model parameters and mappings between image pixels and sources, or clutter. The optimized set of parameters is then used for detection, localization and identification of the multiple sources in the data. The paper includes results computed from experimental spectrometer data.\n",

Our experiments show that the validity-guided fuzzy approach ameliorates the difficulty of choosing correct number of clusters and in conjunction with neural network-based processing technique utilizing a hybrid approach can effectively reduce the blur in the spectrograms. In the course of every partitioning problem the number of subsets must be given before the calculation, but it is rarely known apriori, in this case it must be searched also with using validity measures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\n",

            "4aed7df9-5345-4f8b-96c5-907059d14285 This paper describes our believable judge bot ICE-CIG2011 that has an ability to learn tactics from a judge player and an ability to judge an opponent character as a human or a bot. We conjecture that a bot with these two abilities should be considered human-like in a competition environment, such as BotPrize, where human players participate to compete not only for being the most human-like player but also the best judge. Main contributions of this work lie in our mechanisms for achieving these two abilities. To achieve the former ability, we develop a system and GUI that allow a selected judge player — whose role is to train ICE-CIG2011 — to control his or her character by only deciding which tactic to use under a given situation. We then obtain the judge's tactic log and use it for training tactic selection of ICE-CIG2011 with neuro evolution of augmenting topologies. To achieve the latter ability, we acquire additional logs when the judge character interacts with other opponent characters. In order to represent the play of a known (bot or human) character, we train a neural gas — a kind of self-organizing neural network — from its log. For an unknown character, once its neural gas is trained after a certain period of observation, ICE-CIG2011 decides if it is a human or bot by using the if-nearest-neighbor algorithm; this algorithm considers the majority in the labels of the if-nearest neural gases, of known characters, to the neural gas of that unknown character. Experimental results are given and discussed concerning these two abilities of ICE-CIG2011.\n",

But its potential self-adaptive learning capability has not been paid enough attention in reservoir operation research. In this paper, an operating rule classification system based on LCS , which learns through credit assignment (the bucket brigade algorithm) and rule discovery (the genetic algorithm), is established to extract water-supply reservoir operating rules. The proposed system acquires the online identification rate 95% for training samples and offline rate 85% for testing samples in a case study, and further discussions are made about the impacts on the performances or behaviors of the rule classification system from three aspects of obtained rules, training or testing samples and the comparisons between the rule classification system and the artificial neural network (ANN). The results indicate the learning classifier system is feasible and effective for the system to obtain the reservoir supply operating rules.\n",

In particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter (HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations, we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual users. This model is then used online to predict user satisfaction and set the frequency level accordingly. A second set of user studies demonstrates that iDVFS reduces the CPU power consumption by over 25% in representative applications as compared to the Windows XP DVFS algorithm.\n",

Web usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data obtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has become very critical for effective Web site management, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow analysis and so on. Our previous study on Web usage mining using a concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach has shown that the usage trend analysis very much depends on the performance of the clustering of the number of requests. In this paper, a novel approach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) is introduced to optimize the concurrent architecture of a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover data clusters) and a fuzzy inference system to analyze the trends. In the concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach, self-organizing maps were used to cluster the Web user requests. A hybrid evolutionary FCM approach is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate similar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of evolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Empirical results clearly shows that the proposed technique is efficient with lesser number of if-then rules and improved accuracy at the expense of complicated algorithms and extra computational cost.\n",

This research proposes an approach for modeling the faulty behaviour of digital circuits. It could be applied in a design flow before circuit fabrication. This is achieved by extracting information about faulty behaviour of circuits from low-level models expressed in the VHDL language. Afterwards the extracted information is used to train high-level artificial neural networks models expressed in C/C++ or MATLAB TM  languages. The trained neural network models are able to replicate the behaviour of circuits in presence of faults. The methodology is based on experiments done with two benchmarks, the ISCAS-C17 and a 4-bit multiplier. Results show that the neural network approach leads to models that are more accurate than a previously reported signature generation method. For the C17, using only 30% of the dataset generated with the LIFTING fault simulator, the neural network is able to replicate the output of the circuit in presence of faults with a mean absolute modeling error below 6%.\n",

The jumping parameters are determined by a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain, and the mixed time delays under consideration comprise both time-varying delays and continuously distributed delays. To the best of the authors' knowledge, till now, the exponential stability problem for this class of generalized neural networks has not yet been solved since continuously distributed delays are considered in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using some new approaches and techniques, several novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the trivial solution in the mean square. The results presented in this paper generalize and improve many known results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.\n",

In contrast to most existing trackers which only learn the appearance of the tracked object online, we take a different approach, inspired by recent advances in deep learning architectures, by putting more emphasis on the (unsupervised) feature learning problem. Specifically, by using auxiliary natural images, we train a stacked de-noising autoencoder offline to learn generic image features that are more robust against variations. This is then followed by knowledge transfer from offline training to the online tracking process. Online tracking involves a classification neural network which is constructed from the encoder part of the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor and an additional classification layer. Both the feature extractor and the classifier can be further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging benchmark video sequences shows that our deep learning tracker is more accurate while maintaining low computational cost with real-time performance when our MATLAB implementation of the tracker is used with a modest graphics processing unit (GPU).\n",

However, good generalization results can only be obtained if the structure of the network is suitably chosen. It is shown here that the structure of neurofuzzy networks with scatter partitioning can be obtained from the support vectors (SV) of the Support Vector Regression (SVR), since the SVR can be transformed to a neurofuzzy network. The main advantage of this approach is that the structure of the neurofuzzy networks can now be objectively chosen, as the SV are obtained by constrained optimization for a given modelling error bound. Since neurofuzzy networks are linear-inweights networks, the estimate of the weights of the networks can be obtained by the linear least-squares method. The properties of neurofuzzy networks based on the SV are derived, and its performance is illustrated by a simulation example involving a non...\n",

Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array (MEA) technology. Indeed, high-density MEAs provide large-scale covering (several mm²) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50µm) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of MEA-collected data remain limited. Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data. NeuroMap uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any MEA design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D MEA data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid deformation based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data. The package is distributed under GNU General Public License (GPL) and available at http://sites.google.com/site/neuromapsoftware.\n",

This paper introduces a formal characterization of smooth hinge function (SHF), which can be used to generate SHH as a neural network. A method for the general construction of SHF is also given. Furthermore, the work proves that SHH is better than HH in functional approximation, i.e., the optimal error of SHH approximating a general function is always smaller or equal to that of HH. Particularly, in the case that the SHF is generated via the integration of a class of sigmoidal functions, it is further proven that the corresponding SHH of the 2 m  SHFs would outperform a neural network with  m  of the sigmoidal function from which the SHF is derived. Any upper bound established on the approximation error of a neural network of  m  sigmoidal activation functions can hence be translated to the SHH of  m  SHFs by replacing  m  with  m /2. The work also includes an algorithm for the identification of SHH making use of its differentiability property. Simulation experiments are presented to validate the theoretical conclusions to possible extent.\n",

All SLAM algorithms to date can only be applied in one environment at a time. In this paper we propose to extend SLAM to multi-environments. In SmartSLAM, the robot first classifies its entourage using environment recognition code and then performs SLAM using landmarks that are appropriate for its surrounding milieu. One thousand images of various indoor and outdoor environments were collected and used as training data for a three-layered feedforward backpropagation neural network. This neural network was then tested on two sets of query images of indoor environments and another two sets of outdoor environments, yielding 83% and 95% correct classification rates for the indoor images and 80% and 79% success rates for the outdoor images.\n",

Trajectory analysis is one of the basic problems in behavior understanding, and the learning of trajectory patterns that can be used to detect anomalies and predict object trajectories is an interesting and important problem in trajectory analysis. In this paper, we present a hierarchical self-organizing neural network model and its application to the learning of trajectory distribution patterns for event recognition. The distribution patterns of trajectories are learnt using a hierarchical self-organizing neural network. Using the learned patterns, we consider anomaly detection as well as object behavior prediction. Compared with the existing neural network structures that are used to learn patterns of trajectories, our network structure has smaller scale and faster learning speed, and is thus more effective. Experimental results using two different sets of data demonstrate the accuracy and speed of our hierarchical self-organizing neural network in learning the distribution patterns of object trajectories.\n",

The CRBM is expected to automatically discover common features lurking in time-series data. When we train two CRBMs for a source and target speaker independently using only speaker-dependent training data, it can be considered that each CRBM tries to construct subspaces where there are fewer phonemes and relatively more speaker individuality than the original acoustic space because the training data include various phonemes while keeping the speaker individuality unchanged. Each obtained high-order feature is then concatenated using a neural network (NN) from the source to the target. The entire network (the two CRBMs and the NN) can be also fine-tuned as a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the acoustic parallel data since both the CRBMs and the concatenating NN have network-based representation with time dependencies. Through voice-conversion experiments, we confirmed the high performance of our method especially in terms of objective evaluation, comparing it with conventional GMM, NN, RNN, and our previous work, speaker-dependent DBN approaches.\n",

Texture-analysis methods can be applied to detect clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms. In this paper, a comparative study of texture-analysis methods is performed for the surrounding region-dependence method, which has been proposed by the authors, and conventional texture-analysis methods, such as the spatial gray level dependence method, the gray-level run-length method, and the gray-level difference method. Textural features extracted by these methods are exploited to classify regions of interest (ROI's) into positive ROI's containing clustered microcalcifications and negative ROI's containing normal tissues. A three-layer backpropagation neural network is used as a classifier. The results of the neural network for the texture-analysis methods are evaluated by using a receiver operating-characteristics (ROC) analysis. The surrounding region-dependence method is shown to be superior to the conventional texture-analysis methods with respect to classification accuracy and computational complexity.\n",

The authors presents a new type of classification system, an Adaptive Input Field Neural Network (AIFNN), which includes a simple pre-trained neural network and an elastic input field attached to an input layer. By using an iterative method, AIFNN can determine an optimal affine translation for an elastic input field to compensate for the original deformations. The convergence of the AIFNN algorithm is shown. AIFNN is applied for handwritten numerals recognition. Consequently, 10.83% of originally misclassified patterns are correctly categorized and total performance is improved, without modifying the neural network.\n",

This model is capable of planning real-time robot motion with sudden environmental changes, motion of a car with multiple targets, and motion of multiple robots. The proposed neural network model is biologically inspired, where the dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation. There are only local connections among neurons. The real-time optimal robot motion is planned through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over the free workspace nor the collision paths, without explicitly optimizing any cost functions, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, without any learning process, and without any local collision checking procedures. Therefore it is computationally efficient. The stability of the neural network is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation studies.\n",
            "4b6c0bca-0a22-4767-bb0a-dad3b0ea9d49 A novel fault diagnostics and prediction scheme in continuous-time is introduced for a class of nonlinear systems. The proposed method uses a novel neural network (NN) based robust integral sign of the error (RISE) observer, or estimator, allowing for semi-global asymptotic stability in the presence of NN approximation errors, disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. This is in comparison to typical results presented in the literature that show only boundedness in the presence of uncertainties. The output of the observer/estimator is compared with that of the nonlinear system and a residual is used for declaring the presence of a fault when the residual exceeds a user defined threshold. The NN weights are tuned online with no offline tuning phase. The output of the RISE observer is utilized for diagnostics. Additionally, a method for time-to-failure (TTF) prediction, a first step in prognostics, is developed by projecting the developed parameter-update law under the assumption that the nonlinear system satisfies a linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) assumption. The TTF method uses known critical values of a system to predict when an estimated parameter will reach a known failure threshold. The performance of the NN/RISE observer system is evaluated on a nonlinear system and a simply supported beam finite element analysis (FEA) simulation based on laboratory experiments. Results show that the proposed method provides as much as 25% increased accuracy while the TTF scheme renders a more accurate prediction.\n",

The subpopulations are independently evolved in parallel and occasional migration is employed to allow cooperation between them. The proposed approach is applied to train Pi-Sigma Networks using threshold activation functions. Moreover, the weights and biases were confined to a narrow band of integers, constrained in the range [-32,32]. Thus, the trained Pi-Sigma neural networks can be represented by using 6bits. Such networks are better suited than the real weight ones for hardware implementation and to some extend are immune to low amplitude noise that possibly contaminates the training data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed training process is fast, stable and reliable and the distributed trained Pi-Sigma Networks exhibited good generalization capabilities.\n",

For automatic error detection, two problems have to be solved. The accuracy of the measurement system has to be on a sufficient level and the errors have to be detected in the 3D measurement data. The measuring of the surface shape can be done by an optical 3D measurement system. This system consists of two cameras and one projector. The problem of error detection is solved by a method based on neural networks. The measurement data of one or more master workpieces is stored in the weights of a neural network. The calculation of the difference between the measurement data and the output of the neural network gives the resulting error surface. In the paper, a combination of both technologies is described. This dent detection method is illustrated by an example.\n",

It is required to schedule distributed parallel processes in an appropriate manner. For the scheduling, prediction of execution load of a process is effective to exploit resources of environments. We propose long-term load prediction methods with references of properties of processes and of runtime predictions. Since an appropriate prediction method is different according to the situation, we propose a prediction module selection to select an appropriate prediction method according to a state of changing CPU load using a neural network. We also discuss about the implementation of a long-term CPU load prediction system, which provides information including prediction of load for schedulers, system administrators and users.\n",

In this paper, we propose a general projection neural network for solving a wider class of variational inequalities and related optimization problems. In addition to its simple structure and low complexity, the proposed neural network includes existing neural networks for optimization, such as the projection neural network, the primal-dual neural network, and the dual neural network, as special cases. Under various mild conditions, the proposed general projection neural network is shown to be globally convergent, globally asymptotically stable, and globally exponentially stable. Furthermore, several improved stability criteria on two special cases of the general projection neural network are obtained under weaker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed neural network.\n",

These networks incorporate Gaussian synapses and are trained using a specific algorithm called Gaussian synapse back propagation described here. Gaussian synapses present an intrinsic filtering ability that permit concentrating on what is relevant in the spectra and automatically discard what is not. The networks are structurally adapted to the problem complexity as superfluous synapses and/or nodes are implicitly eliminated by the training procedure, thus pruning the network to the required size straight from the training set. The fundamental difference between the present proposal and other ANN topologies using Gaussian functions is that the latter use these functions as activation functions in the nodes, while in our case, they are used as synaptic elements, allowing them to be easily shaped during the training process to produce any type of n-dimensional discriminator. This paper proposes a multi- and hyperspectral image segmenter that results from the parallel and concurrent application of several of these networks providing a probability vector that is processed by a decision module. Depending on the criteria used for the decision module, different perspectives of the same image may be obtained. The resulting structure offers the possibility of resolving mixtures, that is, carrying out a spectral unmixing process in a very straightforward manner.\n",

            "4b912ab1-ee2a-4a1e-b228-1aa0b27f80ee For the purposes of forecasting (or classification) tasks neural networks (NNs) are typically trained with respect to Euclidean distance minimization. This is commonly the case irrespective of any other end user preferences. In a number of situations, most notably time series forecasting, users may have other objectives in addition to Euclidean distance minimization. Recent studies in the NN domain have confronted this problem by propagating a linear sum of errors. However this approach implicitly assumes a priori knowledge of the error surface defined by the problem, which, typically, is not the case. This study constructs a novel methodology for implementing multiobjective optimization within the evolutionary neural network (ENN) domain. This methodology enables the parallel evolution of a population of ENN models which exhibit estimated Pareto optimality with respect to multiple error measures. A new method is derived from this framework, the Pareto evolutionary neural network (Pareto-ENN). The Pareto-ENN evolves a population of models that may be heterogeneous in their topologies inputs and degree of connectivity, and maintains a set of the Pareto optimal ENNs that it discovers. New generalization methods to deal with the unique properties of multiobjective error minimization that are not apparent in the uni-objective case are presented and compared on synthetic data, with a novel method based on bootstrapping of the training data shown to significantly improve generalization ability. Finally experimental evidence is presented in this study demonstrating the general application potential of the framework by generating populations of ENNs for forecasting 37 different international stock indexes.\n",

It allows one person to interact with a humanoid social robot using natural body language. The robot understands the meaning of human upper body gestures and expresses itself by using a combination of body movements, facial expressions, and verbal language. A set of 12 upper body gestures is involved for communication. This set also includes gestures with human—object interactions. The gestures are characterized by head, arm, and hand posture information. The wearable Immersion CyberGlove II is employed to capture the hand posture. This information is combined with the head and arm posture captured from Microsoft Kinect. This is a new sensor solution for human-gesture capture. Based on the posture data from the CyberGlove II and Kinect, an effective and real-time human gesture recognition method is proposed. The gesture understanding approach based on an innovative combination of sensors is the main contribution of this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed gesture recognition method, a human body gesture data set is built. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can recognize the upper body gestures with high accuracy in real time. In addition, for robot motion generation and control, a novel online motion planning method is proposed. In order to generate appropriate dynamic motion, a quadratic programming (QP)-based dual-arms kinematic motion generation scheme is proposed, and a simplified recurrent neural network is employed to solve the QP problem. The integration of a handshake within the HRI system illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed online generation method.\n",

Self Organizing Map (SOM) and Back Propagation (BP) algorithm were employed to discover the connection between the domain concepts contained in the learning object and the learner’s learning need. The experiment result shows that this approach is assuring in determining a suitable learning object for a particular student in an adaptive and dynamic learning environment.\n",

In the problems studied, the function mapped by an ANN changes during the search carried out by the GA. In the GA proposed, each gene is associated with an independent mutation probability. The knowledge obtained during the evolution is used to update the mutation probabilities. If the modification of a set of genes is useful when the problem changes its profile, the mutation probabilities of these genes are increased. As a result, the search is concentrated into regions associated with genes presenting higher mutation probabilities.\n",

The single-output neuron is trained to be either a zero or a one. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, one-half. The set of inputs that produce an output of one-half forms the classification boundary. The authors adopted an inversion algorithm for the neural network that allows generation of this boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the steepness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pairs are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and presented to an oracle for proper classification. These data are used to refine further the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points. An application example to power system security assessment is given. >\n",

In the past, Viterbi decoders have usually been implemented using digital circuits. The speed of these digital decoders is directly related to the amount of parallelism in the design. As the constraint length of the code increases, parallelism becomes problematic due to the complexity of the decoder. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) Viterbi decoder is presented. The ANN decoder is significantly faster than comparable digital-only designs due to its fully parallel architecture. The fully parallel structure is obtained by implementing most of the Viterbi algorithm using analog neurons as opposed to digital circuits. Several modifications to the ANN decoder are considered, including an analog/digital hybrid design that results in an extremely fast and efficient decoder. The ANN decoder requires one-sixth the number of transistors required by the digital decoder. The connection weights of the ANN decoder are either +1 or -1, so weight considerations in the implementation are eliminated. This, together with the design's modularity and local connectivity, makes the ANN Viterbi decoder a natural fit for VLSI implementation. Simulation results are provided to show that the performance of the ANN decoder matches that of an ideal Viterbi decoder.\n",

Their data are, therefore, valuable for assimilating into general circulation models of the atmosphere. Direct assimilation of radiances from limb sounders is more complex in practice than from nadir sounders due to the need to know the tangent pressures of the measurements. This paper discusses the practical implications of tangent pressures in direct radiance assimilation of limb sounding radiances and demonstrates that a neural network can be used to find these tangent pressures for the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder with a root mean-square error of sigma=50 m, which is comparable with that in traditional retrieval techniques\n",

The defective regions are usually identified through visual judgment with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Five to ten people visually check wafers and hand-mark their defective regions. By this means, potential misjudgment may be introduced due to human fatigue. In addition, the process can incur significant personnel costs. Self-organizing neural networks (SONN) have been proven to have the capabilities of auto-clustering. Automated wafer inspection based on a self-organizing neural network is proposed to replace the traditional electrical testing and the human inspection process.

The Hamiltonian motion equation with the membrane potential is obtained from the neuroelectrophysiological data contaminated by Gaussian white noise. The results of this research show that the mean membrane potential is the exact solution of the motion equation of the membrane potential developed in a previously published paper. It also shows that the Hamiltonian energy function derived in this brief is not only correct but also effective. Particularly, based on the principle of energy coding, an interesting finding is that in some subsets of neurons, firing action potentials at the suprathreshold and some others simultaneously perform activities at the subthreshold level in neural ensembles. Notably, this kind of coupling has not been found in other models of biological neural networks.\n",

An automated classifier which maps from an input space to one of the likelihood ratio family of decision variables is an optimal classifier or \"ideal observer.\" Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are frequently used as classifiers for many problems. In the limit of large training sample sizes, an ANN approximates a mapping function which is a monotonic transformation of the likelihood ratio, i.e., it estimates an ideal observer decision variable. A principal disadvantage of conventional ANNs is the potential over-parameterization of the mapping function which results in a poor approximation of an optimal mapping function for smaller training samples. Recently, Bayesian methods have been applied to ANNs in order to regularize training to improve the robustness of the classifier. The goal of training a Bayesian ANN with finite sample sizes is, as with unlimited data, to approximate the ideal observer. The authors have evaluated the accuracy of Bayesian ANN models of ideal observer decision variables as a function of the number of hidden units used, the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the number of features or dimensionality of the data. The authors show that when enough training data are present, excess hidden units do not substantially degrade the accuracy of Bayesian ANNs. However, the minimum number of hidden units required to best model the optimal mapping function varies with the complexity of the data.\n",

The nonaffine systems are represented by nonlinear auto regressive moving average with exogenous input (NARMAX) model with unknown nonlinear functions. An equivalent affine-like representation for the tracking error dynamics is developed first from the original nonaffine system. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning-based neural network (NN) controller is proposed for the affine-like nonlinear error dynamic system. The control scheme consists of two NNs. One NN is designated as the critic, which approximates a predefined long-term cost function, whereas an action NN is employed to derive a control signal for the system to track a desired trajectory while minimizing the cost function simultaneously. Offline NN training is not required and online NN weight tuning rules are derived. By using the standard Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is demonstrated.\n",

The aim is to identify an image independently of its rotational orientation and size, as well as changing its color intensity. The current techniques such as high-ordered neural network and Zernike moments are not practical to apply to color images of size at least 256 /spl times/ 256 pixels. This paper introduces a novel recognition system, which has less computational time and space than the current techniques. Most implementations for finding machine classifiers are the multi layer perceptron (MLP) of which drawbacks lead to its costly training time and its slow learning behavior. The proposed system builds the classification function based on the concept of support vector machine (SVM) without kernel function of k-NN, called critical support vector machine (CSVM). CSVM is better generalization ability in terms of accuracy rate and lower complexity in terms of computational time and space. In part of invariance, the paper develops the rotational and scaling invariant self-organizing mapping (RSISOM), which composes the Kohonen's learning concept and principle component analysis. RSISOM can capture the features of color images invariant to rotation, scaling and color intensity. In experiment, the proposed system is tested against different 34 colored images with 98.2 % of the correct classification.\n",

In PRONET approach, CP patterns are extracted from a multiview model of a 3D CAD representation of an object. Correspondences are also saved in the CP pattern. A three-layer feed-forward neural network is trained with these CPs. By matching a CP pattern of the given image with that of the neural network, approximate orientation of the object and line-to-line correspondence between image features and CAD features are obtained. An iterative model posing method then calculates the more exact pose of the object based on initial orientation and correspondence. The advantages of this method are (1) since time-consuming portions of the task are executed off-line, an object can be quickly recognized in the execution stage, and (2) correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features can be quickly obtained by matching a single CP pattern, instead of creating many hypotheses and then trying to verify each, and (3) PRONET is tightly integrated with the CAD system.\n",

Traditionally, clinicians make prognostic decisions based on clinicopathologic markers. However, it is not easy for the most skilful clinician to come out with an accurate prognosis by using these markers alone. Thus, there is a need to use genomic markers to improve the accuracy of prognosis. The main aim of this research is to apply a hybrid of feature selection and machine learning methods in oral cancer prognosis based on the parameters of the correlation of clinicopathologic and genomic markers. Results: In the first stage of this research, five feature selection methods have been proposed and experimented on the oral cancer prognosis dataset. In the second stage, the model with the features selected from each feature selection methods are tested on the proposed classifiers. Four types of classifiers are chosen; these are namely, ANFIS, artificial neural network, support vector machine and logistic regression. A k-fold cross-validation is implemented on all types of classifiers due to the small sample size. The hybrid model of ReliefF-GA-ANFIS with 3-input features of drink, invasion and p63 achieved the best accuracy (accuracy = 93.81%; AUC = 0.90) for the oral cancer prognosis. Conclusions: The results revealed that the prognosis is superior with the presence of both clinicopathologic and genomic markers. The selected features can be investigated further to validate the potential of becoming as significant prognostic signature in the oral cancer studies.\n",

The introduction of QESNs is made possible by the recent emergence of quaternion nonlinear activation functions with local analytic properties, required by nonlinear gradient descent training algorithms. To make QENSs second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), we employ augmented quaternion statistics to introduce widely linear QESNs. To that end, the standard widely linear model is modified so as to suit the properties of dynamical reservoir, typically realized by recurrent neural networks. This allows for a full exploitation of second-order information in the data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances, and a rigorous account of second-order noncircularity (improperness), and the corresponding power mismatch and coupling between the data components. Simulations in the prediction setting on both benchmark circular and noncircular signals and on noncircular real-world 3-D body motion data support the analysis.\n",
            "4c068cb5-ac82-4e38-85fe-7401278cf51b This paper develops a quantitative k-nearest neighbors modeling technique. The technique is used to demonstrate that a compound's biological binding activity to a receptor can be calculated from the minimum of the square root of the sum of squared deviations (SSSD) of a structurally assigned chemical shift on a template between the unknown compound to be predicted and a set of known compounds with known activities. When building models of biological activity, nonlinear relationships are built into the input training data. If a model is developed by selecting only compounds with minimum structurally assigned chemical shift deviations from the unknown compound, some of the nonlinear relationships can be removed. The smaller the total chemical shift deviation between a compound with known activity and another compound with unknown activity, the more likely it will have similar biological, chemical, and physical properties. This means that a model can be produced without rigorous statistics or neural networks. This technique is similar to structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling, but instead of relying on substructure fragments to produce a model, this new model is based on minimum chemical shift differences on those substructure fragments. We refer to this method as minimum deviation of structurally assigned spectra analysis (MiDSASA) modeling. Modeling by the minimum deviation concept can be applied to other chemoinformatic data analyses such as metabolite concentrations in metabolic pathways for metabolomics research. A MiDSASA template model for 30 steroids binding the corticosterone binding globulin based on the activity factors of the two nearest compounds had a correlation of 0.88.

            "4c140dad-7f22-44c7-906f-bb10991555e9 Symmetry is useful as a constraint in designing complex systems such as distributed controllers for multilegged robots. However, it is often difficult to determine which symmetries are appropriate. It is therefore desirable to design such systems automatically, e.g., by utilizing evolutionary algorithms that produce symmetry through developmental mechanisms. The success of these algorithms depends on how well they explore the space of valid symmetries. This paper presents an approach called evolution of network symmetry and modularity (ENSO) that utilizes group theory to search the space of symmetries effectively. This approach was evaluated by evolving neural network controllers for a quadruped robot in physically realistic simulations. On flat ground, the resulting controllers are as fast as those having hand-designed symmetry, and significantly faster than those without symmetry. On inclined ground, where the appropriate symmetries are difficult to determine manually, ENSO produced significantly faster gaits that also generalize better than those of other approaches. On robots with a more complicated structure including knee joints, ENSO resulted in more regular gaits than the other approaches. These results suggest that ENSO is a promising approach for evolving complex systems with modularity and symmetry.\n",
            "4c216309-49e4-4726-947a-c73fb986baa2 Neural Networks such as RBFN and BPNN have been widely studied in the area of network intrusion detection, with the purpose of detecting a variety of network anomalies (e.g., worms, malware). In real-world applications, however, the performance of these neural networks is dynamic regarding the use of different datasets. One of the reasons is that there are some redundant features for the dataset. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose an approach of combining Neural Networks with Random Forest to improve the accuracy of detecting network intrusions. In particular, we design an intelligent anomaly detection system that uses the algorithm of Random Forest in the process of feature selection and selects an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments using the KDD1999 dataset and a real dataset respectively. The experimental results indicate that Random Forest can enhance the performance of Neural Networks by identifying important and closely related features and that our developed system can select a better algorithm intelligently.\n",

In the one-dimensional case, an exact analysis establishes the existence of a limiting distribution that is not Gaussian in general. For the general case and small learning constant, a linearization approximation permits the application of results from the theory of random matrices to again establish the existence of a limiting distribution. We study the first few moments of this distribution to compare and contrast the results of our analysis with those of techniques of stochastic approximation.\n",
            "4c2c12e5-0068-43e1-9c34-2ca6a37f19bf This paper presents a fuzzy modeling approach for identification of dynamic systems. In particular, a new fuzzy model, the Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network (DFNN), consisting of recurrent TSK rules, is developed. The premise and defuzzification parts are static while the consequent parts of the fuzzy rules are recurrent neural networks with internal feedback and time delay synapses. The network is trained by means of a novel learning algorithm, named Dynamic-Fuzzy Neural Constrained Optimization Method (D-FUNCOM), based on the concept of constrained optimization. The proposed algorithm is general since it can be applied to locally as well as fully recurrent networks, regardless of their structures. An adaptation mechanism of the maximum parameter change is presented as well. The proposed dynamic model, equipped with the learning algorithm, is applied to several temporal problems, including modeling of a NARMA process and the noise cancellation problem. Performance comparisons are conducted with a series of static and dynamic systems and some existing recurrent fuzzy models. Simulation results show that DFNN compares favorably with its competing rivals and thus it can be considered for efficient system identification.\n",

Developmental systems may alleviate this problem by providing more efficient indirect genotype to phenotype mappings. A novel classification of multi-cellular developmental systems in evolvable hardware is introduced. It shows a category of developmental systems that up to now has rarely been explored. We argue that this category is where most of the benefits of developmental systems lie (e.g. speed, scalability, robustness, inter-cellular and environmental interactions that allow fault-tolerance or adaptivity). This article describes a very simple genetic encoding and developmental system designed for multi-cellular circuits that belongs to this category. We refer to it as the morphogenetic system. The morphogenetic system is inspired by gene expression and cellular differentiation. It focuses on low computational requirements which allows fast execution and a compact hardware implementation. The morphogenetic system shows better scalability compared to a direct genetic encoding in the evolution of structures of differentiated cells, and its dynamics provides fault-tolerance up to high fault rates. It outperforms a direct genetic encoding when evolving spiking neural networks for pattern recognition and robot navigation. The results obtained with the morphogenetic system indicate that this \"minimalist\" approach to developmental systems merits further study.\n",

For coding, it is important that the input parameters that will be used to define this relationship be able to distinguish between the same shape at different scales, as well as different shapes at the same scale. We consider an MRF model, referred to as the Chien model, which accounts for high-order spatial interactions among pixels. We propose to use the statistical moments of the Chien model as input to a neural network to accurately predict the rate and distortion of the binary shape when coded at various scales.\n",

Using the proposed SICL(Spread Pattern Information and Cooperative Learning) algorithm, it is possible to learn analog data accurately and to obtain smooth outputs.

A commonly investigated problem is how complicated dynamics take place in dynamical systems consisting of (often simple) subsystems. It is shown though numerical experiments that emergent order such as periodic behavior can likely take place in coupled chaotic dynamical systems. This is demonstrated for the particular case of coupled chaotic continuous time Hopfield neural networks. In particular, it is shown that when two chaotic Hopfield neural networks are coupled by simple sigmoid signals, periodic behavior can emerge as a consequence of this coupling.\n"

            "Abstract: We studied an autoassociative neural network with dynamic synapses which include a facilitating mechanism. We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, a weighting-delay-based method is developed for the study of the stability problem of a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with time-varying delay. Different from previous results, the delay interval [0, d(t)] is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.\n",

This system can be applied as a stand-alone power supply system or as the emergency power system when the electricity grid fails for all sub-synchronous, synchronous and super-synchronous conditions. The rotor side converter is controlled using the field-oriented control to produce three-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and on-line learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.\n",

Among the schemes that have been developed for this purpose, probability and CF (certainty factor) are the most widely used. If rules are organized according to a connectionist model, then neural network learning suggests a promising solution to this problem. When most rules are correct, semantically incorrect rules can be recognized if their associated certainty factors are weakened or change signs after training with correct samples. The techniques for rule base refinement are examined under this approach. The concept has been implemented and tested in an actual medical expert system. >\n",

(J. Mol. Biol., 300, 1005‐1016, 2000) is a neural network based system which is currently the best predictor in the literature for N-terminal sorting signals. One drawback of neural networks, however, is that it is generally difficult to understand and interpret how and why they make such predictions. In this paper, we aim to generate simple and interpretable rules as predictors, and still achieve a practical prediction accuracy. We adopt an approach which consists of an extensive search for simple rules and various attributes which is partially guided by human intuition. Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose prediction accuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining a very simple and interpretable form. We also discuss and interpret the discovered rules. Availability: An (experimental) web service using rules obtained by our method is provided at http:\n",

            "Abstract: Large-scale traffic networks can be modeled as graphs in which a set of nodes are connected through a set of links that cannot be loaded above their traffic capacities. Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. In this case, a dynamic routing problem arises. The decision makers are realistically assumed 1) to generate their routing decisions on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from other nodes, typically, the neighboring ones and 2) to cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal, that is, the minimization of the total traffic cost. Therefore, they can be regarded as the cooperating members of informationally distributed organizations, which, in control engineering and economics, are called team organizations. Team optimal control problems cannot be solved analytically unless special assumptions on the team model are verified. In general, this is not the case with traffic networks. An approximate resolutive method is then proposed, in which each decision maker is assigned a fixed-structure routing function where some parameters have to be optimized. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feedforward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The routing functions can also be computed (or adapted) locally at each node. Concerning traffic networks, we focus attention on store-and-forward packet switching networks, which exhibit the essential peculiarities and difficulties of other traffic networks. Simulations performed on complex communication networks point out the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

            "Abstract: An integration of a fuzzy controller and modified Elman neural networks (NN) approximation-based computed-torque controller is proposed for motion control of autonomous manipulators in dynamic and partially known environments containing moving obstacles. The navigation technique of robot control using artificial potential fields is based on the fuzzy controller. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and or unstructured unmodeled dynamics of the robot arm. The NN weights are tuned online, with no off-line learning phase required. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. The purpose of the controller, which is designed as a neuro-fuzzy controller, is to generate the commands for the servo-systems of the robot so it may choose its way to its goal autonomously, while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. The proposed scheme has been successfully tested. The controller also demonstrates remarkable performance in adaptation to changes in manipulator dynamics. Sensor-based motion control is an essential feature for dealing with model uncertainties and unexpected obstacles in real-time world systems.\n",

Single- layer and multilayer perceptron networks are used in a study on perceptron topologies and training procedures for pattern classifica- tion of breast masses. The contours of a set of 111 regions on mam- mograms related to breast masses and tumors are manually delin- eated and represented by polygonal models for shape analysis. Ribbons of pixels are extracted around the boundaries of a subset of 57 masses by dilating and eroding the contours. Three shape fac- tors, three measures of edge sharpness, and 14 texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices of the pixels in the rib- bons are computed. Several combinations of the features are used with perceptrons of varying topology and training procedures for the classification of benign masses and malignant tumors. The results are compared in terms of the area Az under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Values of Az up to 0.99 are obtained with the shape factors and texture features. However, only feature sets that included at least one shape factor provide consistently high perfor- mance with respect to variations in network topology and training.\n",

The new approach is specifically designed for these difficult cases. It is developed within the framework of modeling field theory (MFT), a biologically-inspired neural network system that has demonstrated practical value in many diverse areas. MFT performs an efficient optimization over the space of all model parameters and mappings between image pixels and sources, or clutter. The optimized set of parameters is then used for detection, localization and identification of the multiple sources in the data.

            "Abstract: This paper describes our believable judge bot ICE-CIG2011 that has an ability to learn tactics from a judge player and an ability to judge an opponent character as a human or a bot. We conjecture that a bot with these two abilities should be considered human-like in a competition environment, such as BotPrize, where human players participate to compete not only for being the most human-like player but also the best judge. Main contributions of this work lie in our mechanisms for achieving these two abilities. To achieve the former ability, we develop a system and GUI that allow a selected judge player — whose role is to train ICE-CIG2011 — to control his or her character by only deciding which tactic to use under a given situation. We then obtain the judge's tactic log and use it for training tactic selection of ICE-CIG2011 with neuro evolution of augmenting topologies. To achieve the latter ability, we acquire additional logs when the judge character interacts with other opponent characters. In order to represent the play of a known (bot or human) character, we train a neural gas — a kind of self-organizing neural network — from its log. For an unknown character, once its neural gas is trained after a certain period of observation, ICE-CIG2011 decides if it is a human or bot by using the if-nearest-neighbor algorithm; this algorithm considers the majority in the labels of the if-nearest neural gases, of known characters, to the neural gas of that unknown character. Experimental results are given and discussed concerning these two abilities of ICE-CIG2011.\n",

            "Abstract: The ultimate goal of computer design is to satisfy the end-user. In particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter (HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations, we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual users. This model is then used online to predict user satisfaction and set the frequency level accordingly. A second set of user studies demonstrates that iDVFS reduces the CPU power consumption by over 25% in representative applications as compared to the Windows XP DVFS algorithm.\n",

            "Abstract: Recently Web mining has become a hot research topic, which combines two of the prominent research areas comprising of data mining and the World Wide Web (WWW). Web usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data obtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has become very critical for effective Web site management, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow analysis and so on. Our previous study on Web usage mining using a concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach has shown that the usage trend analysis very much depends on the performance of the clustering of the number of requests. In this paper, a novel approach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) is introduced to optimize the concurrent architecture of a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover data clusters) and a fuzzy inference system to analyze the trends. In the concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach, self-organizing maps were used to cluster the Web user requests. A hybrid evolutionary FCM approach is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate similar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of evolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Empirical results clearly shows that the proposed technique is efficient with lesser number of if-then rules and improved accuracy at the expense of complicated algorithms and extra computational cost.\n",

            "Abstract: Cosmic rays lead to soft errors and faulty behavior in electronic circuits. Knowing about their faulty behavior before fabrication would be helpful. This research proposes an approach for modeling the faulty behaviour of digital circuits. It could be applied in a design flow before circuit fabrication. This is achieved by extracting information about faulty behaviour of circuits from low-level models expressed in the VHDL language. Afterwards the extracted information is used to train high-level artificial neural networks models expressed in C/C++ or MATLAB TM  languages. The trained neural network models are able to replicate the behaviour of circuits in presence of faults. The methodology is based on experiments done with two benchmarks, the ISCAS-C17 and a 4-bit multiplier. Results show that the neural network approach leads to models that are more accurate than a previously reported signature generation method. For the C17, using only 30% of the dataset generated with the LIFTING fault simulator, the neural network is able to replicate the output of the circuit in presence of faults with a mean absolute modeling error below 6%.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of exponential stability for a class of Markovian jump impulsive stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed time delays and known or unknown parameters. The jumping parameters are determined by a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain, and the mixed time delays under consideration comprise both time-varying delays and continuously distributed delays. To the best of the authors' knowledge, till now, the exponential stability problem for this class of generalized neural networks has not yet been solved since continuously distributed delays are considered in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using some new approaches and techniques, several novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the trivial solution in the mean square. The results presented in this paper generalize and improve many known results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging problem of tracking the trajectory of a moving object in a video with possibly very complex background. In contrast to most existing trackers which only learn the appearance of the tracked object online, we take a different approach, inspired by recent advances in deep learning architectures, by putting more emphasis on the (unsupervised) feature learning problem. Specifically, by using auxiliary natural images, we train a stacked de-noising autoencoder offline to learn generic image features that are more robust against variations. This is then followed by knowledge transfer from offline training to the online tracking process. Online tracking involves a classification neural network which is constructed from the encoder part of the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor and an additional classification layer. Both the feature extractor and the classifier can be further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging benchmark video sequences shows that our deep learning tracker is more accurate while maintaining low computational cost with real-time performance when our MATLAB implementation of the tracker is used with a modest graphics processing unit (GPU).\n",

            "Abstract: Neurofuzzy networks are being used increasingly to model non-linear dynamic systems, since they have the approximating ability of neural networks and the transparency of fuzzy systems. However, good generalization results can only be obtained if the structure of the network is suitably chosen. It is shown here that the structure of neurofuzzy networks with scatter partitioning can be obtained from the support vectors (SV) of the Support Vector Regression (SVR), since the SVR can be transformed to a neurofuzzy network. The main advantage of this approach is that the structure of the neurofuzzy networks can now be objectively chosen, as the SV are obtained by constrained optimization for a given modelling error bound. Since neurofuzzy networks are linear-inweights networks, the estimate of the weights of the networks can be obtained by the linear least-squares method. The properties of neurofuzzy networks based on the SV are derived, and its performance is illustrated by a simulation example involving a non...\n",

            "Abstract: A major characteristic of neural networks is the complexity of their organization at various spatial scales, from microscopic local circuits to macroscopic brain-scale areas. Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array (MEA) technology. Indeed, high-density MEAs provide large-scale covering (several mm²) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50µm) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of MEA-collected data remain limited. Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data. NeuroMap uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any MEA design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D MEA data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid deformation based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data.

            "Abstract: Smooth hinging hyperplane (SHH) has been proposed as an improvement over the well-known hinging hyperplane (HH) by the fact that it retains the useful features of HH while overcoming HH's drawback of nondifferentiability. This paper introduces a formal characterization of smooth hinge function (SHF), which can be used to generate SHH as a neural network. A method for the general construction of SHF is also given. Furthermore, the work proves that SHH is better than HH in functional approximation, i.e., the optimal error of SHH approximating a general function is always smaller or equal to that of HH. Particularly, in the case that the SHF is generated via the integration of a class of sigmoidal functions, it is further proven that the corresponding SHH of the 2 m  SHFs would outperform a neural network with  m  of the sigmoidal function from which the SHF is derived. Any upper bound established on the approximation error of a neural network of  m  sigmoidal activation functions can hence be translated to the SHH of  m  SHFs by replacing  m  with  m /2. The work also includes an algorithm for the identification of SHH making use of its differentiability property. Simulation experiments are presented to validate the theoretical conclusions to possible extent.\n",

All SLAM algorithms to date can only be applied in one environment at a time. In this paper we propose to extend SLAM to multi-environments. In SmartSLAM, the robot first classifies its entourage using environment recognition code and then performs SLAM using landmarks that are appropriate for its surrounding milieu. One thousand images of various indoor and outdoor environments were collected and used as training data for a three-layered feedforward backpropagation neural network.

Trajectory analysis is one of the basic problems in behavior understanding, and the learning of trajectory patterns that can be used to detect anomalies and predict object trajectories is an interesting and important problem in trajectory analysis. In this paper, we present a hierarchical self-organizing neural network model and its application to the learning of trajectory distribution patterns for event recognition. The distribution patterns of trajectories are learnt using a hierarchical self-organizing neural network. Using the learned patterns, we consider anomaly detection as well as object behavior prediction. Compared with the existing neural network structures that are used to learn patterns of trajectories, our network structure has smaller scale and faster learning speed, and is thus more effective. Experimental results using two different sets of data demonstrate the accuracy and speed of our hierarchical self-organizing neural network in learning the distribution patterns of object trajectories.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a voice conversion (VC) method that utilizes conditional restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs) for each speaker to obtain high-order speaker-independent spaces where voice features are converted more easily than those in an original acoustic feature space. The CRBM is expected to automatically discover common features lurking in time-series data. When we train two CRBMs for a source and target speaker independently using only speaker-dependent training data, it can be considered that each CRBM tries to construct subspaces where there are fewer phonemes and relatively more speaker individuality than the original acoustic space because the training data include various phonemes while keeping the speaker individuality unchanged. Each obtained high-order feature is then concatenated using a neural network (NN) from the source to the target. The entire network (the two CRBMs and the NN) can be also fine-tuned as a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the acoustic parallel data since both the CRBMs and the concatenating NN have network-based representation with time dependencies. Through voice-conversion experiments, we confirmed the high performance of our method especially in terms of objective evaluation, comparing it with conventional GMM, NN, RNN, and our previous work, speaker-dependent DBN approaches.\n",

In particular, a FBF network is compared with a radial basis function (RBF) network from the viewpoint of function approximation. Their architectural interrelationships are discussed. Additionally, a RBF network, which is implemented using a regularization technique, is compared with a FBF network from the viewpoint of overcoming ill-posed problems.

Textural features extracted by these methods are exploited to classify regions of interest (ROI's) into positive ROI's containing clustered microcalcifications and negative ROI's containing normal tissues. A three-layer backpropagation neural network is used as a classifier.

This model is capable of planning real-time robot motion with sudden environmental changes, motion of a car with multiple targets, and motion of multiple robots. The proposed neural network model is biologically inspired, where the dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation. There are only local connections among neurons. The real-time optimal robot motion is planned through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over the free workspace nor the collision paths, without explicitly optimizing any cost functions, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, without any learning process, and without any local collision checking procedures. Therefore it is computationally efficient. The stability of the neural network is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation studies.\n",

            "Abstract: A novel fault diagnostics and prediction scheme in continuous-time is introduced for a class of nonlinear systems. The proposed method uses a novel neural network (NN) based robust integral sign of the error (RISE) observer, or estimator, allowing for semi-global asymptotic stability in the presence of NN approximation errors, disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. This is in comparison to typical results presented in the literature that show only boundedness in the presence of uncertainties. The output of the observer/estimator is compared with that of the nonlinear system and a residual is used for declaring the presence of a fault when the residual exceeds a user defined threshold. The NN weights are tuned online with no offline tuning phase. The output of the RISE observer is utilized for diagnostics. Additionally, a method for time-to-failure (TTF) prediction, a first step in prognostics, is developed by projecting the developed parameter-update law under the assumption that the nonlinear system satisfies a linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) assumption. The TTF method uses known critical values of a system to predict when an estimated parameter will reach a known failure threshold. The performance of the NN/RISE observer system is evaluated on a nonlinear system and a simply supported beam finite element analysis (FEA) simulation based on laboratory experiments. Results show that the proposed method provides as much as 25% increased accuracy while the TTF scheme renders a more accurate prediction.\n",

More specifically the distributed versions of the Differential Evolution and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms have been employed. To this end, each processor is assigned a subpopulation of potential solutions. The subpopulations are independently evolved in parallel and occasional migration is employed to allow cooperation between them. The proposed approach is applied to train Pi-Sigma Networks using threshold activation functions. Moreover, the weights and biases were confined to a narrow band of integers, constrained in the range [-32,32]. Thus, the trained Pi-Sigma neural networks can be represented by using 6bits. Such networks are better suited than the real weight ones for hardware implementation and to some extend are immune to low amplitude noise that possibly contaminates the training data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed training process is fast, stable and reliable and the distributed trained Pi-Sigma Networks exhibited good generalization capabilities.\n",

The measuring of the surface shape can be done by an optical 3D measurement system. This system consists of two cameras and one projector. The problem of error detection is solved by a method based on neural networks. The measurement data of one or more master workpieces is stored in the weights of a neural network. The calculation of the difference between the measurement data and the output of the neural network gives the resulting error surface. In the paper, a combination of both technologies is described.

            "Abstract: A new type of artificial neural network is used to identify different crops and ground elements from hyperspectral remote sensing data sets. These networks incorporate Gaussian synapses and are trained using a specific algorithm called Gaussian synapse back propagation described here. Gaussian synapses present an intrinsic filtering ability that permit concentrating on what is relevant in the spectra and automatically discard what is not. The networks are structurally adapted to the problem complexity as superfluous synapses and/or nodes are implicitly eliminated by the training procedure, thus pruning the network to the required size straight from the training set. The fundamental difference between the present proposal and other ANN topologies using Gaussian functions is that the latter use these functions as activation functions in the nodes, while in our case, they are used as synaptic elements, allowing them to be easily shaped during the training process to produce any type of n-dimensional discriminator. This paper proposes a multi- and hyperspectral image segmenter that results from the parallel and concurrent application of several of these networks providing a probability vector that is processed by a decision module. Depending on the criteria used for the decision module, different perspectives of the same image may be obtained. The resulting structure offers the possibility of resolving mixtures, that is, carrying out a spectral unmixing process in a very straightforward manner.\n",

            "Abstract: For the purposes of forecasting (or classification) tasks neural networks (NNs) are typically trained with respect to Euclidean distance minimization. This is commonly the case irrespective of any other end user preferences. In a number of situations, most notably time series forecasting, users may have other objectives in addition to Euclidean distance minimization. Recent studies in the NN domain have confronted this problem by propagating a linear sum of errors. However this approach implicitly assumes a priori knowledge of the error surface defined by the problem, which, typically, is not the case. This study constructs a novel methodology for implementing multiobjective optimization within the evolutionary neural network (ENN) domain. This methodology enables the parallel evolution of a population of ENN models which exhibit estimated Pareto optimality with respect to multiple error measures. A new method is derived from this framework, the Pareto evolutionary neural network (Pareto-ENN). The Pareto-ENN evolves a population of models that may be heterogeneous in their topologies inputs and degree of connectivity, and maintains a set of the Pareto optimal ENNs that it discovers. New generalization methods to deal with the unique properties of multiobjective error minimization that are not apparent in the uni-objective case are presented and compared on synthetic data, with a novel method based on bootstrapping of the training data shown to significantly improve generalization ability. Finally experimental evidence is presented in this study demonstrating the general application potential of the framework by generating populations of ENNs for forecasting 37 different international stock indexes.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, a human—robot interaction system based on a novel combination of sensors is proposed. It allows one person to interact with a humanoid social robot using natural body language. The robot understands the meaning of human upper body gestures and expresses itself by using a combination of body movements, facial expressions, and verbal language. A set of 12 upper body gestures is involved for communication. This set also includes gestures with human—object interactions. The gestures are characterized by head, arm, and hand posture information. The wearable Immersion CyberGlove II is employed to capture the hand posture. This information is combined with the head and arm posture captured from Microsoft Kinect. This is a new sensor solution for human-gesture capture. Based on the posture data from the CyberGlove II and Kinect, an effective and real-time human gesture recognition method is proposed. The gesture understanding approach based on an innovative combination of sensors is the main contribution of this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed gesture recognition method, a human body gesture data set is built. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can recognize the upper body gestures with high accuracy in real time. In addition, for robot motion generation and control, a novel online motion planning method is proposed. In order to generate appropriate dynamic motion, a quadratic programming (QP)-based dual-arms kinematic motion generation scheme is proposed, and a simplified recurrent neural network is employed to solve the QP problem. The integration of a handshake within the HRI system illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed online generation method.\n",

In the problems studied, the function mapped by an ANN changes during the search carried out by the GA. In the GA proposed, each gene is associated with an independent mutation probability. The knowledge obtained during the evolution is used to update the mutation probabilities. If the modification of a set of genes is useful when the problem changes its profile, the mutation probabilities of these genes are increased. As a result, the search is concentrated into regions associated with genes presenting higher mutation probabilities.\n",

            "Abstract: An approach is presented for query-based neural network learning. A layered perceptron partially trained for binary classification is considered. The single-output neuron is trained to be either a zero or a one. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, one-half. The set of inputs that produce an output of one-half forms the classification boundary. The authors adopted an inversion algorithm for the neural network that allows generation of this boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the steepness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pairs are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and presented to an oracle for proper classification. These data are used to refine further the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points. An application example to power system security assessment is given. >\n",

We adopt a method of reduce the number of the wavelet basic function by analysis the sparse property of sample data, and use the learning algorithm based on gradient descent to train network. We select the index of sludge compost quality and take the high temperature duration, degradation rate, nitrogen content, average oxygen concentration and maturity degree as the evaluation parameters. With the ability of strong self-learning and function approach and fast convergence rate of wavelet neural network, the modeling method can truly evaluate the compost quality by learning the index information of sludge compost quality.

We propose a new type of neural network classiers with multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, but where the usual mean square error minimization principle is substituted by the minimiza- tion of Shannon's entropy of the dierences between the MLP's out- put and the desired target.

            "Abstract: The Viterbi algorithm is a maximum likelihood means for decoding convolutional codes and has thus played an important role in applications ranging from satellite communications to cellular telephony. In the past, Viterbi decoders have usually been implemented using digital circuits. The speed of these digital decoders is directly related to the amount of parallelism in the design. As the constraint length of the code increases, parallelism becomes problematic due to the complexity of the decoder. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) Viterbi decoder is presented. The ANN decoder is significantly faster than comparable digital-only designs due to its fully parallel architecture. The fully parallel structure is obtained by implementing most of the Viterbi algorithm using analog neurons as opposed to digital circuits. Several modifications to the ANN decoder are considered, including an analog/digital hybrid design that results in an extremely fast and efficient decoder. The ANN decoder requires one-sixth the number of transistors required by the digital decoder. The connection weights of the ANN decoder are either +1 or -1, so weight considerations in the implementation are eliminated. This, together with the design's modularity and local connectivity, makes the ANN Viterbi decoder a natural fit for VLSI implementation. Simulation results are provided to show that the performance of the ANN decoder matches that of an ideal Viterbi decoder.\n",

Their data are, therefore, valuable for assimilating into general circulation models of the atmosphere. Direct assimilation of radiances from limb sounders is more complex in practice than from nadir sounders due to the need to know the tangent pressures of the measurements. This paper discusses the practical implications of tangent pressures in direct radiance assimilation of limb sounding radiances and demonstrates that a neural network can be used to find these tangent pressures for the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder with a root mean-square error of sigma=50 m, which is comparable with that in traditional retrieval techniques\n",

The defective regions are usually identified through visual judgment with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Five to ten people visually check wafers and hand-mark their defective regions. By this means, potential misjudgment may be introduced due to human fatigue. In addition, the process can incur significant personnel costs. Self-organizing neural networks (SONN) have been proven to have the capabilities of auto-clustering. Automated wafer inspection based on a self-organizing neural network is proposed to replace the traditional electrical testing and the human inspection process. Based on real world data, experimental results show that the proposed method successfully identifies the defective regions on wafers with good performances.\n",

The energy function is used to describe the energy evolution of the neuronal population with time and the coupled relationship between neurons at the subthreshold and the suprathreshold states. The Hamiltonian motion equation with the membrane potential is obtained from the neuroelectrophysiological data contaminated by Gaussian white noise. The results of this research show that the mean membrane potential is the exact solution of the motion equation of the membrane potential developed in a previously published paper. It also shows that the Hamiltonian energy function derived in this brief is not only correct but also effective. Particularly, based on the principle of energy coding, an interesting finding is that in some subsets of neurons, firing action potentials at the suprathreshold and some others simultaneously perform activities at the subthreshold level in neural ensembles. Notably, this kind of coupling has not been found in other models of biological neural networks.\n",

At the setup stage, the auxiliary detector detects the user's transmitted data and at the same time feeds these output data to the main MLP detector as its training data, and the main detector is trained by using the well-known backpropagation (BP) algorithm. After the training process, the auxiliary detector stops work and the main detector starts detecting the user's transmitted data self-adaptively.

            "Abstract: It is well understood that the optimal classification decision variable is the likelihood ratio or any monotonic transformation of the likelihood ratio. An automated classifier which maps from an input space to one of the likelihood ratio family of decision variables is an optimal classifier or \"ideal observer.\" Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are frequently used as classifiers for many problems. In the limit of large training sample sizes, an ANN approximates a mapping function which is a monotonic transformation of the likelihood ratio, i.e., it estimates an ideal observer decision variable. A principal disadvantage of conventional ANNs is the potential over-parameterization of the mapping function which results in a poor approximation of an optimal mapping function for smaller training samples. Recently, Bayesian methods have been applied to ANNs in order to regularize training to improve the robustness of the classifier. The goal of training a Bayesian ANN with finite sample sizes is, as with unlimited data, to approximate the ideal observer. The authors have evaluated the accuracy of Bayesian ANN models of ideal observer decision variables as a function of the number of hidden units used, the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the number of features or dimensionality of the data. The authors show that when enough training data are present, excess hidden units do not substantially degrade the accuracy of Bayesian ANNs. However, the minimum number of hidden units required to best model the optimal mapping function varies with the complexity of the data.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, a novel neural network (NN) based online reinforcement learning controller is designed for nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems with bounded disturbances. The nonaffine systems are represented by nonlinear auto regressive moving average with exogenous input (NARMAX) model with unknown nonlinear functions. An equivalent affine-like representation for the tracking error dynamics is developed first from the original nonaffine system. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning-based neural network (NN) controller is proposed for the affine-like nonlinear error dynamic system. The control scheme consists of two NNs. One NN is designated as the critic, which approximates a predefined long-term cost function, whereas an action NN is employed to derive a control signal for the system to track a desired trajectory while minimizing the cost function simultaneously. Offline NN training is not required and online NN weight tuning rules are derived. By using the standard Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is demonstrated.\n",

            "Abstract: Invariant image recognition is one of the hardest problems in computer vision. The aim is to identify an image independently of its rotational orientation and size, as well as changing its color intensity. The current techniques such as high-ordered neural network and Zernike moments are not practical to apply to color images of size at least 256 /spl times/ 256 pixels. This paper introduces a novel recognition system, which has less computational time and space than the current techniques. Most implementations for finding machine classifiers are the multi layer perceptron (MLP) of which drawbacks lead to its costly training time and its slow learning behavior. The proposed system builds the classification function based on the concept of support vector machine (SVM) without kernel function of k-NN, called critical support vector machine (CSVM). CSVM is better generalization ability in terms of accuracy rate and lower complexity in terms of computational time and space. In part of invariance, the paper develops the rotational and scaling invariant self-organizing mapping (RSISOM), which composes the Kohonen's learning concept and principle component analysis. RSISOM can capture the features of color images invariant to rotation, scaling and color intensity. In experiment, the proposed system is tested against different 34 colored images with 98.2 % of the correct classification.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper proposes a centroidal profile (CP) and neural network based 3D object recognition and localization method (PRONET). In PRONET approach, CP patterns are extracted from a multiview model of a 3D CAD representation of an object. Correspondences are also saved in the CP pattern. A three-layer feed-forward neural network is trained with these CPs. By matching a CP pattern of the given image with that of the neural network, approximate orientation of the object and line-to-line correspondence between image features and CAD features are obtained. An iterative model posing method then calculates the more exact pose of the object based on initial orientation and correspondence. The advantages of this method are (1) since time-consuming portions of the task are executed off-line, an object can be quickly recognized in the execution stage, and (2) correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features can be quickly obtained by matching a single CP pattern, instead of creating many hypotheses and then trying to verify each, and (3) PRONET is tightly integrated with the CAD system.\n",

            "Abstract: Background: Machine learning techniques are becoming useful as an alternative approach to conventional medical diagnosis or prognosis as they are good for handling noisy and incomplete data, and significant results can be attained despite a small sample size. Traditionally, clinicians make prognostic decisions based on clinicopathologic markers. However, it is not easy for the most skilful clinician to come out with an accurate prognosis by using these markers alone. Thus, there is a need to use genomic markers to improve the accuracy of prognosis. The main aim of this research is to apply a hybrid of feature selection and machine learning methods in oral cancer prognosis based on the parameters of the correlation of clinicopathologic and genomic markers. Results: In the first stage of this research, five feature selection methods have been proposed and experimented on the oral cancer prognosis dataset. In the second stage, the model with the features selected from each feature selection methods are tested on the proposed classifiers. Four types of classifiers are chosen; these are namely, ANFIS, artificial neural network, support vector machine and logistic regression. A k-fold cross-validation is implemented on all types of classifiers due to the small sample size. The hybrid model of ReliefF-GA-ANFIS with 3-input features of drink, invasion and p63 achieved the best accuracy (accuracy = 93.81%; AUC = 0.90) for the oral cancer prognosis. Conclusions: The results revealed that the prognosis is superior with the presence of both clinicopathologic and genomic markers. The selected features can be investigated further to validate the potential of becoming as significant prognostic signature in the oral cancer studies.\n",

            "Abstract: Quaternion-valued echo state networks (QESNs) are introduced to cater for 3-D and 4-D processes, such as those observed in the context of renewable energy (3-D wind modeling) and human centered computing (3-D inertial body sensors). The introduction of QESNs is made possible by the recent emergence of quaternion nonlinear activation functions with local analytic properties, required by nonlinear gradient descent training algorithms. To make QENSs second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), we employ augmented quaternion statistics to introduce widely linear QESNs. To that end, the standard widely linear model is modified so as to suit the properties of dynamical reservoir, typically realized by recurrent neural networks. This allows for a full exploitation of second-order information in the data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances, and a rigorous account of second-order noncircularity (improperness), and the corresponding power mismatch and coupling between the data components. Simulations in the prediction setting on both benchmark circular and noncircular signals and on noncircular real-world 3-D body motion data support the analysis.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper develops a quantitative k-nearest neighbors modeling technique. The technique is used to demonstrate that a compound's biological binding activity to a receptor can be calculated from the minimum of the square root of the sum of squared deviations (SSSD) of a structurally assigned chemical shift on a template between the unknown compound to be predicted and a set of known compounds with known activities. When building models of biological activity, nonlinear relationships are built into the input training data. If a model is developed by selecting only compounds with minimum structurally assigned chemical shift deviations from the unknown compound, some of the nonlinear relationships can be removed. The smaller the total chemical shift deviation between a compound with known activity and another compound with unknown activity, the more likely it will have similar biological, chemical, and physical properties. This means that a model can be produced without rigorous statistics or neural networks. This technique is similar to structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling, but instead of relying on substructure fragments to produce a model, this new model is based on minimum chemical shift differences on those substructure fragments. We refer to this method as minimum deviation of structurally assigned spectra analysis (MiDSASA) modeling. Modeling by the minimum deviation concept can be applied to other chemoinformatic data analyses such as metabolite concentrations in metabolic pathways for metabolomics research. A MiDSASA template model for 30 steroids binding the corticosterone binding globulin based on the activity factors of the two nearest compounds had a correlation of 0.88. A MiDSASA template model for 50 steroids binding the aromatse enzyme based on the average activity of the four nearest compounds had a correlation of 0.71.\n",

            "Abstract: Symmetry is useful as a constraint in designing complex systems such as distributed controllers for multilegged robots. However, it is often difficult to determine which symmetries are appropriate. It is therefore desirable to design such systems automatically, e.g., by utilizing evolutionary algorithms that produce symmetry through developmental mechanisms. The success of these algorithms depends on how well they explore the space of valid symmetries. This paper presents an approach called evolution of network symmetry and modularity (ENSO) that utilizes group theory to search the space of symmetries effectively. This approach was evaluated by evolving neural network controllers for a quadruped robot in physically realistic simulations. On flat ground, the resulting controllers are as fast as those having hand-designed symmetry, and significantly faster than those without symmetry. On inclined ground, where the appropriate symmetries are difficult to determine manually, ENSO produced significantly faster gaits that also generalize better than those of other approaches. On robots with a more complicated structure including knee joints, ENSO resulted in more regular gaits than the other approaches. These results suggest that ENSO is a promising approach for evolving complex systems with modularity and symmetry.\n",

            "Abstract: Neural Networks such as RBFN and BPNN have been widely studied in the area of network intrusion detection, with the purpose of detecting a variety of network anomalies (e.g., worms, malware). In real-world applications, however, the performance of these neural networks is dynamic regarding the use of different datasets. One of the reasons is that there are some redundant features for the dataset. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose an approach of combining Neural Networks with Random Forest to improve the accuracy of detecting network intrusions. In particular, we design an intelligent anomaly detection system that uses the algorithm of Random Forest in the process of feature selection and selects an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments using the KDD1999 dataset and a real dataset respectively. The experimental results indicate that Random Forest can enhance the performance of Neural Networks by identifying important and closely related features and that our developed system can select a better algorithm intelligently.\n",

In the one-dimensional case, an exact analysis establishes the existence of a limiting distribution that is not Gaussian in general. For the general case and small learning constant, a linearization approximation permits the application of results from the theory of random matrices to again establish the existence of a limiting distribution. We study the first few moments of this distribution to compare and contrast the results of our analysis with those of techniques of stochastic approximation.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a fuzzy modeling approach for identification of dynamic systems. In particular, a new fuzzy model, the Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network (DFNN), consisting of recurrent TSK rules, is developed. The premise and defuzzification parts are static while the consequent parts of the fuzzy rules are recurrent neural networks with internal feedback and time delay synapses. The network is trained by means of a novel learning algorithm, named Dynamic-Fuzzy Neural Constrained Optimization Method (D-FUNCOM), based on the concept of constrained optimization. The proposed algorithm is general since it can be applied to locally as well as fully recurrent networks, regardless of their structures. An adaptation mechanism of the maximum parameter change is presented as well. The proposed dynamic model, equipped with the learning algorithm, is applied to several temporal problems, including modeling of a NARMA process and the noise cancellation problem. Performance comparisons are conducted with a series of static and dynamic systems and some existing recurrent fuzzy models. Simulation results show that DFNN compares favorably with its competing rivals and thus it can be considered for efficient system identification.\n",

            "Abstract: With a gene required for each phenotypic trait, direct genetic encodings may show poor scalability to increasing phenotype length. Developmental systems may alleviate this problem by providing more efficient indirect genotype to phenotype mappings. A novel classification of multi-cellular developmental systems in evolvable hardware is introduced. It shows a category of developmental systems that up to now has rarely been explored. We argue that this category is where most of the benefits of developmental systems lie (e.g. speed, scalability, robustness, inter-cellular and environmental interactions that allow fault-tolerance or adaptivity). This article describes a very simple genetic encoding and developmental system designed for multi-cellular circuits that belongs to this category. We refer to it as the morphogenetic system. The morphogenetic system is inspired by gene expression and cellular differentiation. It focuses on low computational requirements which allows fast execution and a compact hardware implementation. The morphogenetic system shows better scalability compared to a direct genetic encoding in the evolution of structures of differentiated cells, and its dynamics provides fault-tolerance up to high fault rates. It outperforms a direct genetic encoding when evolving spiking neural networks for pattern recognition and robot navigation. The results obtained with the morphogenetic system indicate that this \"minimalist\" approach to developmental systems merits further study.\n",

For coding, it is important that the input parameters that will be used to define this relationship be able to distinguish between the same shape at different scales, as well as different shapes at the same scale. We consider an MRF model, referred to as the Chien model, which accounts for high-order spatial interactions among pixels. We propose to use the statistical moments of the Chien model as input to a neural network to accurately predict the rate and distortion of the binary shape when coded at various scales.\n",

A commonly investigated problem is how complicated dynamics take place in dynamical systems consisting of (often simple) subsystems. It is shown though numerical experiments that emergent order such as periodic behavior can likely take place in coupled chaotic dynamical systems. This is demonstrated for the particular case of coupled chaotic continuous time Hopfield neural networks. In particular, it is shown that when two chaotic Hopfield neural networks are coupled by simple sigmoid signals, periodic behavior can emerge as a consequence of this coupling.\n",

We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.\n",

Different from previous results, the delay interval [0, d(t)] is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.\n",

We adopt an approach which consists of an extensive search for simple rules and various attributes which is partially guided by human intuition. Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose prediction accuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining a very simple and interpretable form.

Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. In this case, a dynamic routing problem arises. The decision makers are realistically assumed 1) to generate their routing decisions on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from other nodes, typically, the neighboring ones and 2) to cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal, that is, the minimization of the total traffic cost. Therefore, they can be regarded as the cooperating members of informationally distributed organizations, which, in control engineering and economics, are called team organizations. Team optimal control problems cannot be solved analytically unless special assumptions on the team model are verified. In general, this is not the case with traffic networks. An approximate resolutive method is then proposed, in which each decision maker is assigned a fixed-structure routing function where some parameters have to be optimized. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feedforward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The routing functions can also be computed (or adapted) locally at each node. Concerning traffic networks, we focus attention on store-and-forward packet switching networks, which exhibit the essential peculiarities and difficulties of other traffic networks. Simulations performed on complex communication networks point out the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

The navigation technique of robot control using artificial potential fields is based on the fuzzy controller. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and or unstructured unmodeled dynamics of the robot arm. The NN weights are tuned online, with no off-line learning phase required. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. The purpose of the controller, which is designed as a neuro-fuzzy controller, is to generate the commands for the servo-systems of the robot so it may choose its way to its goal autonomously, while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. The proposed scheme has been successfully tested. The controller also demonstrates remarkable performance in adaptation to changes in manipulator dynamics.

Single- layer and multilayer perceptron networks are used in a study on perceptron topologies and training procedures for pattern classifica- tion of breast masses. The contours of a set of 111 regions on mam- mograms related to breast masses and tumors are manually delin- eated and represented by polygonal models for shape analysis. Ribbons of pixels are extracted around the boundaries of a subset of 57 masses by dilating and eroding the contours. Three shape fac- tors, three measures of edge sharpness, and 14 texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices of the pixels in the rib- bons are computed. Several combinations of the features are used with perceptrons of varying topology and training procedures for the classification of benign masses and malignant tumors. The results are compared in terms of the area Az under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Values of Az up to 0.99 are obtained with the shape factors and texture features. However, only feature sets that included at least one shape factor provide consistently high perfor- mance with respect to variations in network topology and training.\n",

This is especially true in the field of urban railway transport where video-based surveillance can be exploited to face many relevant security aspects (e.g. vandalism, overcrowding, abandoned object detection etc.). This paper aims at investigating an open problem in the implementation of video-based surveillance systems for transport applications, i.e., the implementation of reliable image understanding modules in order to recognize dangerous situations with reduced false alarm and misdetection rates. We considered the use of a neural network-based classifier for detecting vandal behavior in metro stations. The achieved results show that the classifier achieves very good performance even in the presence of high scene complexity.\n",

Pseudo-imaging, which involves the automatic localization, spectrum estimation, and identification of energetic sources, can be difficult for dim sources and/or noisy images, or in data containing multiple sources which are closely spaced such that their signatures overlap. The new approach is specifically designed for these difficult cases. It is developed within the framework of modeling field theory (MFT), a biologically-inspired neural network system that has demonstrated practical value in many diverse areas. MFT performs an efficient optimization over the space of all model parameters and mappings between image pixels and sources, or clutter. The optimized set of parameters is then used for detection, localization and identification of the multiple sources in the data. The paper includes results computed from experimental spectrometer data.\n",

We conjecture that a bot with these two abilities should be considered human-like in a competition environment, such as BotPrize, where human players participate to compete not only for being the most human-like player but also the best judge. Main contributions of this work lie in our mechanisms for achieving these two abilities. To achieve the former ability, we develop a system and GUI that allow a selected judge player — whose role is to train ICE-CIG2011 — to control his or her character by only deciding which tactic to use under a given situation. We then obtain the judge's tactic log and use it for training tactic selection of ICE-CIG2011 with neuro evolution of augmenting topologies. To achieve the latter ability, we acquire additional logs when the judge character interacts with other opponent characters. In order to represent the play of a known (bot or human) character, we train a neural gas — a kind of self-organizing neural network — from its log. For an unknown character, once its neural gas is trained after a certain period of observation, ICE-CIG2011 decides if it is a human or bot by using the if-nearest-neighbor algorithm; this algorithm considers the majority in the labels of the if-nearest neural gases, of known characters, to the neural gas of that unknown character. Experimental results are given and discussed concerning these two abilities of ICE-CIG2011.\n",

But its potential self-adaptive learning capability has not been paid enough attention in reservoir operation research. In this paper, an operating rule classification system based on LCS , which learns through credit assignment (the bucket brigade algorithm) and rule discovery (the genetic algorithm), is established to extract water-supply reservoir operating rules. The proposed system acquires the online identification rate 95% for training samples and offline rate 85% for testing samples in a case study, and further discussions are made about the impacts on the performances or behaviors of the rule classification system from three aspects of obtained rules, training or testing samples and the comparisons between the rule classification system and the artificial neural network (ANN). The results indicate the learning classifier system is feasible and effective for the system to obtain the reservoir supply operating rules.\n",

In particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter (HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations, we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual users. This model is then used online to predict user satisfaction and set the frequency level accordingly. A second set of user studies demonstrates that iDVFS reduces the CPU power consumption by over 25% in representative applications as compared to the Windows XP DVFS algorithm.\n",

Web usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data obtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has become very critical for effective Web site management, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow analysis and so on. Our previous study on Web usage mining using a concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach has shown that the usage trend analysis very much depends on the performance of the clustering of the number of requests. In this paper, a novel approach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) is introduced to optimize the concurrent architecture of a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover data clusters) and a fuzzy inference system to analyze the trends. In the concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach, self-organizing maps were used to cluster the Web user requests. A hybrid evolutionary FCM approach is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate similar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of evolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Empirical results clearly shows that the proposed technique is efficient with lesser number of if-then rules and improved accuracy at the expense of complicated algorithms and extra computational cost.\n",

Knowing about their faulty behavior before fabrication would be helpful. This research proposes an approach for modeling the faulty behaviour of digital circuits. It could be applied in a design flow before circuit fabrication. This is achieved by extracting information about faulty behaviour of circuits from low-level models expressed in the VHDL language. Afterwards the extracted information is used to train high-level artificial neural networks models expressed in C/C++ or MATLAB TM  languages. The trained neural network models are able to replicate the behaviour of circuits in presence of faults. The methodology is based on experiments done with two benchmarks, the ISCAS-C17 and a 4-bit multiplier. Results show that the neural network approach leads to models that are more accurate than a previously reported signature generation method. For the C17, using only 30% of the dataset generated with the LIFTING fault simulator, the neural network is able to replicate the output of the circuit in presence of faults with a mean absolute modeling error below 6%.\n",

The jumping parameters are determined by a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain, and the mixed time delays under consideration comprise both time-varying delays and continuously distributed delays. To the best of the authors' knowledge, till now, the exponential stability problem for this class of generalized neural networks has not yet been solved since continuously distributed delays are considered in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using some new approaches and techniques, several novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the trivial solution in the mean square. The results presented in this paper generalize and improve many known results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.\n",

In contrast to most existing trackers which only learn the appearance of the tracked object online, we take a different approach, inspired by recent advances in deep learning architectures, by putting more emphasis on the (unsupervised) feature learning problem. Specifically, by using auxiliary natural images, we train a stacked de-noising autoencoder offline to learn generic image features that are more robust against variations. This is then followed by knowledge transfer from offline training to the online tracking process. Online tracking involves a classification neural network which is constructed from the encoder part of the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor and an additional classification layer. Both the feature extractor and the classifier can be further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging benchmark video sequences shows that our deep learning tracker is more accurate while maintaining low computational cost with real-time performance when our MATLAB implementation of the tracker is used with a modest graphics processing unit (GPU).\n",

However, good generalization results can only be obtained if the structure of the network is suitably chosen. It is shown here that the structure of neurofuzzy networks with scatter partitioning can be obtained from the support vectors (SV) of the Support Vector Regression (SVR), since the SVR can be transformed to a neurofuzzy network. The main advantage of this approach is that the structure of the neurofuzzy networks can now be objectively chosen, as the SV are obtained by constrained optimization for a given modelling error bound. Since neurofuzzy networks are linear-inweights networks, the estimate of the weights of the networks can be obtained by the linear least-squares method. The properties of neurofuzzy networks based on the SV are derived, and its performance is illustrated by a simulation example involving a non...\n",

Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array (MEA) technology. Indeed, high-density MEAs provide large-scale covering (several mm²) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50µm) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of MEA-collected data remain limited. Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data. NeuroMap uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any MEA design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D MEA data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid deformation based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data.

This paper introduces a formal characterization of smooth hinge function (SHF), which can be used to generate SHH as a neural network. A method for the general construction of SHF is also given. Furthermore, the work proves that SHH is better than HH in functional approximation, i.e., the optimal error of SHH approximating a general function is always smaller or equal to that of HH. Particularly, in the case that the SHF is generated via the integration of a class of sigmoidal functions, it is further proven that the corresponding SHH of the 2 m  SHFs would outperform a neural network with  m  of the sigmoidal function from which the SHF is derived. Any upper bound established on the approximation error of a neural network of  m  sigmoidal activation functions can hence be translated to the SHH of  m  SHFs by replacing  m  with  m /2. The work also includes an algorithm for the identification of SHH making use of its differentiability property. Simulation experiments are presented to validate the theoretical conclusions to possible extent.\n",

All SLAM algorithms to date can only be applied in one environment at a time. In this paper we propose to extend SLAM to multi-environments. In SmartSLAM, the robot first classifies its entourage using environment recognition code and then performs SLAM using landmarks that are appropriate for its surrounding milieu. One thousand images of various indoor and outdoor environments were collected and used as training data for a three-layered feedforward backpropagation neural network. This neural network was then tested on two sets of query images of indoor environments and another two sets of outdoor environments, yielding 83% and 95% correct classification rates for the indoor images and 80% and 79% success rates for the outdoor images.\n",

Trajectory analysis is one of the basic problems in behavior understanding, and the learning of trajectory patterns that can be used to detect anomalies and predict object trajectories is an interesting and important problem in trajectory analysis. In this paper, we present a hierarchical self-organizing neural network model and its application to the learning of trajectory distribution patterns for event recognition. The distribution patterns of trajectories are learnt using a hierarchical self-organizing neural network. Using the learned patterns, we consider anomaly detection as well as object behavior prediction. Compared with the existing neural network structures that are used to learn patterns of trajectories, our network structure has smaller scale and faster learning speed, and is thus more effective. Experimental results using two different sets of data demonstrate the accuracy and speed of our hierarchical self-organizing neural network in learning the distribution patterns of object trajectories.\n",

The CRBM is expected to automatically discover common features lurking in time-series data. When we train two CRBMs for a source and target speaker independently using only speaker-dependent training data, it can be considered that each CRBM tries to construct subspaces where there are fewer phonemes and relatively more speaker individuality than the original acoustic space because the training data include various phonemes while keeping the speaker individuality unchanged. Each obtained high-order feature is then concatenated using a neural network (NN) from the source to the target. The entire network (the two CRBMs and the NN) can be also fine-tuned as a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the acoustic parallel data since both the CRBMs and the concatenating NN have network-based representation with time dependencies. Through voice-conversion experiments, we confirmed the high performance of our method especially in terms of objective evaluation, comparing it with conventional GMM, NN, RNN, and our previous work, speaker-dependent DBN approaches.\n",

Because a FBF network is different from other networks in that it is the only one that can combine numerical and linguistic information, comparisons are made when only numerical data is available. In particular, a FBF network is compared with a radial basis function (RBF) network from the viewpoint of function approximation. Their architectural interrelationships are discussed. Additionally, a RBF network, which is implemented using a regularization technique, is compared with a FBF network from the viewpoint of overcoming ill-posed problems. A FBF network is also compared with Specht's probabilistic neural network and his general regression neural network (GRNN) from an architectural point of view.

Texture-analysis methods can be applied to detect clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms. In this paper, a comparative study of texture-analysis methods is performed for the surrounding region-dependence method, which has been proposed by the authors, and conventional texture-analysis methods, such as the spatial gray level dependence method, the gray-level run-length method, and the gray-level difference method. Textural features extracted by these methods are exploited to classify regions of interest (ROI's) into positive ROI's containing clustered microcalcifications and negative ROI's containing normal tissues. A three-layer backpropagation neural network is used as a classifier. The results of the neural network for the texture-analysis methods are evaluated by using a receiver operating-characteristics (ROC) analysis. The surrounding region-dependence method is shown to be superior to the conventional texture-analysis methods with respect to classification accuracy and computational complexity.\n",

This model is capable of planning real-time robot motion with sudden environmental changes, motion of a car with multiple targets, and motion of multiple robots. The proposed neural network model is biologically inspired, where the dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation. There are only local connections among neurons. The real-time optimal robot motion is planned through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over the free workspace nor the collision paths, without explicitly optimizing any cost functions, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, without any learning process, and without any local collision checking procedures. Therefore it is computationally efficient. The stability of the neural network is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation studies.\n",
            "Paper ID: 4b6c0bca-0a22-4767-bb0a-dad3b0ea9d49, Title: Robust neural network RISE observer based fault diagnostics and prediction, Abstract: A novel fault diagnostics and prediction scheme in continuous-time is introduced for a class of nonlinear systems. The proposed method uses a novel neural network (NN) based robust integral sign of the error (RISE) observer, or estimator, allowing for semi-global asymptotic stability in the presence of NN approximation errors, disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. This is in comparison to typical results presented in the literature that show only boundedness in the presence of uncertainties. The output of the observer/estimator is compared with that of the nonlinear system and a residual is used for declaring the presence of a fault when the residual exceeds a user defined threshold. The NN weights are tuned online with no offline tuning phase. The output of the RISE observer is utilized for diagnostics. Additionally, a method for time-to-failure (TTF) prediction, a first step in prognostics, is developed by projecting the developed parameter-update law under the assumption that the nonlinear system satisfies a linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) assumption. The TTF method uses known critical values of a system to predict when an estimated parameter will reach a known failure threshold. The performance of the NN/RISE observer system is evaluated on a nonlinear system and a simply supported beam finite element analysis (FEA) simulation based on laboratory experiments. Results show that the proposed method provides as much as 25% increased accuracy while the TTF scheme renders a more accurate prediction.\n",

The performance of Pi-Sigma Networks is evaluated through several well known Neural Network Training benchmarks. In the experiments reported here, Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms are implemented for Pi-Sigma neural networks training. More specifically the distributed versions of the Differential Evolution and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms have been employed. To this end, each processor is assigned a subpopulation of potential solutions. The subpopulations are independently evolved in parallel and occasional migration is employed to allow cooperation between them. The proposed approach is applied to train Pi-Sigma Networks using threshold activation functions. Moreover, the weights and biases were confined to a narrow band of integers, constrained in the range [-32,32]. Thus, the trained Pi-Sigma neural networks can be represented by using 6bits. Such networks are better suited than the real weight ones for hardware implementation and to some extend are immune to low amplitude noise that possibly contaminates the training data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed training process is fast, stable and reliable and the distributed trained Pi-Sigma Networks exhibited good generalization capabilities.\n",

The measuring of the surface shape can be done by an optical 3D measurement system. This system consists of two cameras and one projector.

The calculation of the difference between the measurement data and the output of the neural network gives the resulting error surface. In the paper, a combination of both technologies is described. This dent detection method is illustrated by an example.\n",

It is required to schedule distributed parallel processes in an appropriate manner. For the scheduling, prediction of execution load of a process is effective to exploit resources of environments. We propose long-term load prediction methods with references of properties of processes and of runtime predictions. Since an appropriate prediction method is different according to the situation, we propose a prediction module selection to select an appropriate prediction method according to a state of changing CPU load using a neural network. We also discuss about the implementation of a long-term CPU load prediction system, which provides information including prediction of load for schedulers, system administrators and users.\n",

In this paper, we propose a general projection neural network for solving a wider class of variational inequalities and related optimization problems. In addition to its simple structure and low complexity, the proposed neural network includes existing neural networks for optimization, such as the projection neural network, the primal-dual neural network, and the dual neural network, as special cases. Under various mild conditions, the proposed general projection neural network is shown to be globally convergent, globally asymptotically stable, and globally exponentially stable. Furthermore, several improved stability criteria on two special cases of the general projection neural network are obtained under weaker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed neural network.\n",

These networks incorporate Gaussian synapses and are trained using a specific algorithm called Gaussian synapse back propagation described here. Gaussian synapses present an intrinsic filtering ability that permit concentrating on what is relevant in the spectra and automatically discard what is not. The networks are structurally adapted to the problem complexity as superfluous synapses and/or nodes are implicitly eliminated by the training procedure, thus pruning the network to the required size straight from the training set. The fundamental difference between the present proposal and other ANN topologies using Gaussian functions is that the latter use these functions as activation functions in the nodes, while in our case, they are used as synaptic elements, allowing them to be easily shaped during the training process to produce any type of n-dimensional discriminator. This paper proposes a multi- and hyperspectral image segmenter that results from the parallel and concurrent application of several of these networks providing a probability vector that is processed by a decision module. Depending on the criteria used for the decision module, different perspectives of the same image may be obtained. The resulting structure offers the possibility of resolving mixtures, that is, carrying out a spectral unmixing process in a very straightforward manner.\n",

            "Paper ID: 4b912ab1-ee2a-4a1e-b228-1aa0b27f80ee, Title: Pareto evolutionary neural networks, Abstract: For the purposes of forecasting (or classification) tasks neural networks (NNs) are typically trained with respect to Euclidean distance minimization. This is commonly the case irrespective of any other end user preferences. In a number of situations, most notably time series forecasting, users may have other objectives in addition to Euclidean distance minimization. Recent studies in the NN domain have confronted this problem by propagating a linear sum of errors. However this approach implicitly assumes a priori knowledge of the error surface defined by the problem, which, typically, is not the case. This study constructs a novel methodology for implementing multiobjective optimization within the evolutionary neural network (ENN) domain. This methodology enables the parallel evolution of a population of ENN models which exhibit estimated Pareto optimality with respect to multiple error measures. A new method is derived from this framework, the Pareto evolutionary neural network (Pareto-ENN). The Pareto-ENN evolves a population of models that may be heterogeneous in their topologies inputs and degree of connectivity, and maintains a set of the Pareto optimal ENNs that it discovers. New generalization methods to deal with the unique properties of multiobjective error minimization that are not apparent in the uni-objective case are presented and compared on synthetic data, with a novel method based on bootstrapping of the training data shown to significantly improve generalization ability. Finally experimental evidence is presented in this study demonstrating the general application potential of the framework by generating populations of ENNs for forecasting 37 different international stock indexes.\n",

It allows one person to interact with a humanoid social robot using natural body language. The robot understands the meaning of human upper body gestures and expresses itself by using a combination of body movements, facial expressions, and verbal language. A set of 12 upper body gestures is involved for communication. This set also includes gestures with human—object interactions. The gestures are characterized by head, arm, and hand posture information. The wearable Immersion CyberGlove II is employed to capture the hand posture. This information is combined with the head and arm posture captured from Microsoft Kinect. This is a new sensor solution for human-gesture capture. Based on the posture data from the CyberGlove II and Kinect, an effective and real-time human gesture recognition method is proposed. The gesture understanding approach based on an innovative combination of sensors is the main contribution of this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed gesture recognition method, a human body gesture data set is built. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can recognize the upper body gestures with high accuracy in real time. In addition, for robot motion generation and control, a novel online motion planning method is proposed. In order to generate appropriate dynamic motion, a quadratic programming (QP)-based dual-arms kinematic motion generation scheme is proposed, and a simplified recurrent neural network is employed to solve the QP problem. The integration of a handshake within the HRI system illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed online generation method.\n",

In the problems studied, the function mapped by an ANN changes during the search carried out by the GA. In the GA proposed, each gene is associated with an independent mutation probability. The knowledge obtained during the evolution is used to update the mutation probabilities. If the modification of a set of genes is useful when the problem changes its profile, the mutation probabilities of these genes are increased. As a result, the search is concentrated into regions associated with genes presenting higher mutation probabilities.\n",

A layered perceptron partially trained for binary classification is considered. The single-output neuron is trained to be either a zero or a one. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, one-half. The set of inputs that produce an output of one-half forms the classification boundary. The authors adopted an inversion algorithm for the neural network that allows generation of this boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the steepness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pairs are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and presented to an oracle for proper classification. These data are used to refine further the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points. An application example to power system security assessment is given. >\n",

In the past, Viterbi decoders have usually been implemented using digital circuits. The speed of these digital decoders is directly related to the amount of parallelism in the design. As the constraint length of the code increases, parallelism becomes problematic due to the complexity of the decoder. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) Viterbi decoder is presented. The ANN decoder is significantly faster than comparable digital-only designs due to its fully parallel architecture. The fully parallel structure is obtained by implementing most of the Viterbi algorithm using analog neurons as opposed to digital circuits. Several modifications to the ANN decoder are considered, including an analog/digital hybrid design that results in an extremely fast and efficient decoder. The ANN decoder requires one-sixth the number of transistors required by the digital decoder. The connection weights of the ANN decoder are either +1 or -1, so weight considerations in the implementation are eliminated. This, together with the design's modularity and local connectivity, makes the ANN Viterbi decoder a natural fit for VLSI implementation. Simulation results are provided to show that the performance of the ANN decoder matches that of an ideal Viterbi decoder.\n",

Their data are, therefore, valuable for assimilating into general circulation models of the atmosphere. Direct assimilation of radiances from limb sounders is more complex in practice than from nadir sounders due to the need to know the tangent pressures of the measurements. This paper discusses the practical implications of tangent pressures in direct radiance assimilation of limb sounding radiances and demonstrates that a neural network can be used to find these tangent pressures for the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder with a root mean-square error of sigma=50 m, which is comparable with that in traditional retrieval techniques\n",

The defective regions are usually identified through visual judgment with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Five to ten people visually check wafers and hand-mark their defective regions.

The energy function is used to describe the energy evolution of the neuronal population with time and the coupled relationship between neurons at the subthreshold and the suprathreshold states. The Hamiltonian motion equation with the membrane potential is obtained from the neuroelectrophysiological data contaminated by Gaussian white noise. The results of this research show that the mean membrane potential is the exact solution of the motion equation of the membrane potential developed in a previously published paper. It also shows that the Hamiltonian energy function derived in this brief is not only correct but also effective. Particularly, based on the principle of energy coding, an interesting finding is that in some subsets of neurons, firing action potentials at the suprathreshold and some others simultaneously perform activities at the subthreshold level in neural ensembles. Notably, this kind of coupling has not been found in other models of biological neural networks.\n",

An automated classifier which maps from an input space to one of the likelihood ratio family of decision variables is an optimal classifier or \"ideal observer.\" Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are frequently used as classifiers for many problems. In the limit of large training sample sizes, an ANN approximates a mapping function which is a monotonic transformation of the likelihood ratio, i.e., it estimates an ideal observer decision variable. A principal disadvantage of conventional ANNs is the potential over-parameterization of the mapping function which results in a poor approximation of an optimal mapping function for smaller training samples. Recently, Bayesian methods have been applied to ANNs in order to regularize training to improve the robustness of the classifier. The goal of training a Bayesian ANN with finite sample sizes is, as with unlimited data, to approximate the ideal observer. The authors have evaluated the accuracy of Bayesian ANN models of ideal observer decision variables as a function of the number of hidden units used, the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the number of features or dimensionality of the data. The authors show that when enough training data are present, excess hidden units do not substantially degrade the accuracy of Bayesian ANNs. However, the minimum number of hidden units required to best model the optimal mapping function varies with the complexity of the data.\n",

The nonaffine systems are represented by nonlinear auto regressive moving average with exogenous input (NARMAX) model with unknown nonlinear functions. An equivalent affine-like representation for the tracking error dynamics is developed first from the original nonaffine system. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning-based neural network (NN) controller is proposed for the affine-like nonlinear error dynamic system. The control scheme consists of two NNs. One NN is designated as the critic, which approximates a predefined long-term cost function, whereas an action NN is employed to derive a control signal for the system to track a desired trajectory while minimizing the cost function simultaneously. Offline NN training is not required and online NN weight tuning rules are derived. By using the standard Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is demonstrated.\n",

The aim is to identify an image independently of its rotational orientation and size, as well as changing its color intensity. The current techniques such as high-ordered neural network and Zernike moments are not practical to apply to color images of size at least 256 /spl times/ 256 pixels. This paper introduces a novel recognition system, which has less computational time and space than the current techniques. Most implementations for finding machine classifiers are the multi layer perceptron (MLP) of which drawbacks lead to its costly training time and its slow learning behavior. The proposed system builds the classification function based on the concept of support vector machine (SVM) without kernel function of k-NN, called critical support vector machine (CSVM). CSVM is better generalization ability in terms of accuracy rate and lower complexity in terms of computational time and space. In part of invariance, the paper develops the rotational and scaling invariant self-organizing mapping (RSISOM), which composes the Kohonen's learning concept and principle component analysis. RSISOM can capture the features of color images invariant to rotation, scaling and color intensity. In experiment, the proposed system is tested against different 34 colored images with 98.2 % of the correct classification.\n",

In PRONET approach, CP patterns are extracted from a multiview model of a 3D CAD representation of an object. Correspondences are also saved in the CP pattern. A three-layer feed-forward neural network is trained with these CPs. By matching a CP pattern of the given image with that of the neural network, approximate orientation of the object and line-to-line correspondence between image features and CAD features are obtained. An iterative model posing method then calculates the more exact pose of the object based on initial orientation and correspondence. The advantages of this method are (1) since time-consuming portions of the task are executed off-line, an object can be quickly recognized in the execution stage, and (2) correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features can be quickly obtained by matching a single CP pattern, instead of creating many hypotheses and then trying to verify each, and (3) PRONET is tightly integrated with the CAD system.\n",

Traditionally, clinicians make prognostic decisions based on clinicopathologic markers. However, it is not easy for the most skilful clinician to come out with an accurate prognosis by using these markers alone. Thus, there is a need to use genomic markers to improve the accuracy of prognosis. The main aim of this research is to apply a hybrid of feature selection and machine learning methods in oral cancer prognosis based on the parameters of the correlation of clinicopathologic and genomic markers. Results: In the first stage of this research, five feature selection methods have been proposed and experimented on the oral cancer prognosis dataset. In the second stage, the model with the features selected from each feature selection methods are tested on the proposed classifiers. Four types of classifiers are chosen; these are namely, ANFIS, artificial neural network, support vector machine and logistic regression. A k-fold cross-validation is implemented on all types of classifiers due to the small sample size. The hybrid model of ReliefF-GA-ANFIS with 3-input features of drink, invasion and p63 achieved the best accuracy (accuracy = 93.81%; AUC = 0.90) for the oral cancer prognosis. Conclusions: The results revealed that the prognosis is superior with the presence of both clinicopathologic and genomic markers. The selected features can be investigated further to validate the potential of becoming as significant prognostic signature in the oral cancer studies.\n",

The introduction of QESNs is made possible by the recent emergence of quaternion nonlinear activation functions with local analytic properties, required by nonlinear gradient descent training algorithms. To make QENSs second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), we employ augmented quaternion statistics to introduce widely linear QESNs. To that end, the standard widely linear model is modified so as to suit the properties of dynamical reservoir, typically realized by recurrent neural networks. This allows for a full exploitation of second-order information in the data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances, and a rigorous account of second-order noncircularity (improperness), and the corresponding power mismatch and coupling between the data components. Simulations in the prediction setting on both benchmark circular and noncircular signals and on noncircular real-world 3-D body motion data support the analysis.\n",

The technique is used to demonstrate that a compound's biological binding activity to a receptor can be calculated from the minimum of the square root of the sum of squared deviations (SSSD) of a structurally assigned chemical shift on a template between the unknown compound to be predicted and a set of known compounds with known activities. When building models of biological activity, nonlinear relationships are built into the input training data. If a model is developed by selecting only compounds with minimum structurally assigned chemical shift deviations from the unknown compound, some of the nonlinear relationships can be removed. The smaller the total chemical shift deviation between a compound with known activity and another compound with unknown activity, the more likely it will have similar biological, chemical, and physical properties. This means that a model can be produced without rigorous statistics or neural networks. This technique is similar to structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling, but instead of relying on substructure fragments to produce a model, this new model is based on minimum chemical shift differences on those substructure fragments. We refer to this method as minimum deviation of structurally assigned spectra analysis (MiDSASA) modeling. Modeling by the minimum deviation concept can be applied to other chemoinformatic data analyses such as metabolite concentrations in metabolic pathways for metabolomics research. A MiDSASA template model for 30 steroids binding the corticosterone binding globulin based on the activity factors of the two nearest compounds had a correlation of 0.88. A MiDSASA template model for 50 steroids binding the aromatse enzyme based on the average activity of the four nearest compounds had a correlation of 0.71.\n",

However, it is often difficult to determine which symmetries are appropriate. It is therefore desirable to design such systems automatically, e.g., by utilizing evolutionary algorithms that produce symmetry through developmental mechanisms. The success of these algorithms depends on how well they explore the space of valid symmetries. This paper presents an approach called evolution of network symmetry and modularity (ENSO) that utilizes group theory to search the space of symmetries effectively. This approach was evaluated by evolving neural network controllers for a quadruped robot in physically realistic simulations. On flat ground, the resulting controllers are as fast as those having hand-designed symmetry, and significantly faster than those without symmetry. On inclined ground, where the appropriate symmetries are difficult to determine manually, ENSO produced significantly faster gaits that also generalize better than those of other approaches. On robots with a more complicated structure including knee joints, ENSO resulted in more regular gaits than the other approaches. These results suggest that ENSO is a promising approach for evolving complex systems with modularity and symmetry.\n",

In real-world applications, however, the performance of these neural networks is dynamic regarding the use of different datasets. One of the reasons is that there are some redundant features for the dataset. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose an approach of combining Neural Networks with Random Forest to improve the accuracy of detecting network intrusions. In particular, we design an intelligent anomaly detection system that uses the algorithm of Random Forest in the process of feature selection and selects an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments using the KDD1999 dataset and a real dataset respectively. The experimental results indicate that Random Forest can enhance the performance of Neural Networks by identifying important and closely related features and that our developed system can select a better algorithm intelligently.\n",

In the one-dimensional case, an exact analysis establishes the existence of a limiting distribution that is not Gaussian in general. For the general case and small learning constant, a linearization approximation permits the application of results from the theory of random matrices to again establish the existence of a limiting distribution. We study the first few moments of this distribution to compare and contrast the results of our analysis with those of techniques of stochastic approximation.\n",

In particular, a new fuzzy model, the Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network (DFNN), consisting of recurrent TSK rules, is developed. The premise and defuzzification parts are static while the consequent parts of the fuzzy rules are recurrent neural networks with internal feedback and time delay synapses. The network is trained by means of a novel learning algorithm, named Dynamic-Fuzzy Neural Constrained Optimization Method (D-FUNCOM), based on the concept of constrained optimization. The proposed algorithm is general since it can be applied to locally as well as fully recurrent networks, regardless of their structures. An adaptation mechanism of the maximum parameter change is presented as well. The proposed dynamic model, equipped with the learning algorithm, is applied to several temporal problems, including modeling of a NARMA process and the noise cancellation problem. Performance comparisons are conducted with a series of static and dynamic systems and some existing recurrent fuzzy models. Simulation results show that DFNN compares favorably with its competing rivals and thus it can be considered for efficient system identification.\n",

Developmental systems may alleviate this problem by providing more efficient indirect genotype to phenotype mappings. A novel classification of multi-cellular developmental systems in evolvable hardware is introduced. It shows a category of developmental systems that up to now has rarely been explored. We argue that this category is where most of the benefits of developmental systems lie (e.g. speed, scalability, robustness, inter-cellular and environmental interactions that allow fault-tolerance or adaptivity). This article describes a very simple genetic encoding and developmental system designed for multi-cellular circuits that belongs to this category. We refer to it as the morphogenetic system. The morphogenetic system is inspired by gene expression and cellular differentiation. It focuses on low computational requirements which allows fast execution and a compact hardware implementation. The morphogenetic system shows better scalability compared to a direct genetic encoding in the evolution of structures of differentiated cells, and its dynamics provides fault-tolerance up to high fault rates. It outperforms a direct genetic encoding when evolving spiking neural networks for pattern recognition and robot navigation. The results obtained with the morphogenetic system indicate that this \"minimalist\" approach to developmental systems merits further study.\n",

For coding, it is important that the input parameters that will be used to define this relationship be able to distinguish between the same shape at different scales, as well as different shapes at the same scale.

We propose to use the statistical moments of the Chien model as input to a neural network to accurately predict the rate and distortion of the binary shape when coded at various scales.\n",

A commonly investigated problem is how complicated dynamics take place in dynamical systems consisting of (often simple) subsystems. It is shown though numerical experiments that emergent order such as periodic behavior can likely take place in coupled chaotic dynamical systems. This is demonstrated for the particular case of coupled chaotic continuous time Hopfield neural networks. In particular, it is shown that when two chaotic Hopfield neural networks are coupled by simple sigmoid signals, periodic behavior can emerge as a consequence of this coupling.?\n",

We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.\n",

Different from previous results, the delay interval [0, d(t)] is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.\n",

Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and on-line learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.\n",

TargetP, by Emanuelsson et al. (J. Mol. Biol., 300, 1005‐1016, 2000) is a neural network based system which is currently the best predictor in the literature for N-terminal sorting signals. One drawback of neural networks, however, is that it is generally difficult to understand and interpret how and why they make such predictions. In this paper, we aim to generate simple and interpretable rules as predictors, and still achieve a practical prediction accuracy. We adopt an approach which consists of an extensive search for simple rules and various attributes which is partially guided by human intuition. Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose prediction accuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining a very simple and interpretable form. We also discuss and interpret the discovered rules. Availability: An (experimental) web service using rules obtained by our method is provided at http:\n",

Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. In this case, a dynamic routing problem arises. The decision makers are realistically assumed 1) to generate their routing decisions on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from other nodes, typically, the neighboring ones and 2) to cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal, that is, the minimization of the total traffic cost. Therefore, they can be regarded as the cooperating members of informationally distributed organizations, which, in control engineering and economics, are called team organizations. Team optimal control problems cannot be solved analytically unless special assumptions on the team model are verified. In general, this is not the case with traffic networks. An approximate resolutive method is then proposed, in which each decision maker is assigned a fixed-structure routing function where some parameters have to be optimized. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feedforward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The routing functions can also be computed (or adapted) locally at each node. Concerning traffic networks, we focus attention on store-and-forward packet switching networks, which exhibit the essential peculiarities and difficulties of other traffic networks. Simulations performed on complex communication networks point out the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

The navigation technique of robot control using artificial potential fields is based on the fuzzy controller. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and or unstructured unmodeled dynamics of the robot arm. The NN weights are tuned online, with no off-line learning phase required. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. The purpose of the controller, which is designed as a neuro-fuzzy controller, is to generate the commands for the servo-systems of the robot so it may choose its way to its goal autonomously, while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. The proposed scheme has been successfully tested. The controller also demonstrates remarkable performance in adaptation to changes in manipulator dynamics. Sensor-based motion control is an essential feature for dealing with model uncertainties and unexpected obstacles in real-time world systems.\n",

Single- layer and multilayer perceptron networks are used in a study on perceptron topologies and training procedures for pattern classifica- tion of breast masses. The contours of a set of 111 regions on mam- mograms related to breast masses and tumors are manually delin- eated and represented by polygonal models for shape analysis. Ribbons of pixels are extracted around the boundaries of a subset of 57 masses by dilating and eroding the contours. Three shape fac- tors, three measures of edge sharpness, and 14 texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices of the pixels in the rib- bons are computed. Several combinations of the features are used with perceptrons of varying topology and training procedures for the classification of benign masses and malignant tumors. The results are compared in terms of the area Az under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Values of Az up to 0.99 are obtained with the shape factors and texture features. However, only feature sets that included at least one shape factor provide consistently high perfor- mance with respect to variations in network topology and training.\n",

Pseudo-imaging, which involves the automatic localization, spectrum estimation, and identification of energetic sources, can be difficult for dim sources and/or noisy images, or in data containing multiple sources which are closely spaced such that their signatures overlap. The new approach is specifically designed for these difficult cases. It is developed within the framework of modeling field theory (MFT), a biologically-inspired neural network system that has demonstrated practical value in many diverse areas. MFT performs an efficient optimization over the space of all model parameters and mappings between image pixels and sources, or clutter. The optimized set of parameters is then used for detection, localization and identification of the multiple sources in the data. The paper includes results computed from experimental spectrometer data.\n",

In the course of every partitioning problem the number of subsets must be given before the calculation, but it is rarely known apriori, in this case it must be searched also with using validity measures.

We conjecture that a bot with these two abilities should be considered human-like in a competition environment, such as BotPrize, where human players participate to compete not only for being the most human-like player but also the best judge. Main contributions of this work lie in our mechanisms for achieving these two abilities. To achieve the former ability, we develop a system and GUI that allow a selected judge player — whose role is to train ICE-CIG2011 — to control his or her character by only deciding which tactic to use under a given situation. We then obtain the judge's tactic log and use it for training tactic selection of ICE-CIG2011 with neuro evolution of augmenting topologies. To achieve the latter ability, we acquire additional logs when the judge character interacts with other opponent characters. In order to represent the play of a known (bot or human) character, we train a neural gas — a kind of self-organizing neural network — from its log. For an unknown character, once its neural gas is trained after a certain period of observation, ICE-CIG2011 decides if it is a human or bot by using the if-nearest-neighbor algorithm; this algorithm considers the majority in the labels of the if-nearest neural gases, of known characters, to the neural gas of that unknown character. Experimental results are given and discussed concerning these two abilities of ICE-CIG2011.\n",

But its potential self-adaptive learning capability has not been paid enough attention in reservoir operation research. In this paper, an operating rule classification system based on LCS , which learns through credit assignment (the bucket brigade algorithm) and rule discovery (the genetic algorithm), is established to extract water-supply reservoir operating rules. The proposed system acquires the online identification rate 95% for training samples and offline rate 85% for testing samples in a case study, and further discussions are made about the impacts on the performances or behaviors of the rule classification system from three aspects of obtained rules, training or testing samples and the comparisons between the rule classification system and the artificial neural network (ANN).

In particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter (HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations, we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual users. This model is then used online to predict user satisfaction and set the frequency level accordingly. A second set of user studies demonstrates that iDVFS reduces the CPU power consumption by over 25% in representative applications as compared to the Windows XP DVFS algorithm.\n",

Web usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data obtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has become very critical for effective Web site management, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow analysis and so on. Our previous study on Web usage mining using a concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach has shown that the usage trend analysis very much depends on the performance of the clustering of the number of requests. In this paper, a novel approach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) is introduced to optimize the concurrent architecture of a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover data clusters) and a fuzzy inference system to analyze the trends. In the concurrent neuro-fuzzy approach, self-organizing maps were used to cluster the Web user requests. A hybrid evolutionary FCM approach is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate similar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of evolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Empirical results clearly shows that the proposed technique is efficient with lesser number of if-then rules and improved accuracy at the expense of complicated algorithms and extra computational cost.\n",

Knowing about their faulty behavior before fabrication would be helpful. This research proposes an approach for modeling the faulty behaviour of digital circuits. It could be applied in a design flow before circuit fabrication. This is achieved by extracting information about faulty behaviour of circuits from low-level models expressed in the VHDL language. Afterwards the extracted information is used to train high-level artificial neural networks models expressed in C/C++ or MATLAB TM  languages. The trained neural network models are able to replicate the behaviour of circuits in presence of faults. The methodology is based on experiments done with two benchmarks, the ISCAS-C17 and a 4-bit multiplier. Results show that the neural network approach leads to models that are more accurate than a previously reported signature generation method. For the C17, using only 30% of the dataset generated with the LIFTING fault simulator, the neural network is able to replicate the output of the circuit in presence of faults with a mean absolute modeling error below 6%.\n",

The jumping parameters are determined by a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain, and the mixed time delays under consideration comprise both time-varying delays and continuously distributed delays. To the best of the authors' knowledge, till now, the exponential stability problem for this class of generalized neural networks has not yet been solved since continuously distributed delays are considered in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using some new approaches and techniques, several novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the trivial solution in the mean square. The results presented in this paper generalize and improve many known results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.\n",

In contrast to most existing trackers which only learn the appearance of the tracked object online, we take a different approach, inspired by recent advances in deep learning architectures, by putting more emphasis on the (unsupervised) feature learning problem. Specifically, by using auxiliary natural images, we train a stacked de-noising autoencoder offline to learn generic image features that are more robust against variations. This is then followed by knowledge transfer from offline training to the online tracking process. Online tracking involves a classification neural network which is constructed from the encoder part of the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor and an additional classification layer. Both the feature extractor and the classifier can be further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging benchmark video sequences shows that our deep learning tracker is more accurate while maintaining low computational cost with real-time performance when our MATLAB implementation of the tracker is used with a modest graphics processing unit (GPU).\n",

However, good generalization results can only be obtained if the structure of the network is suitably chosen. It is shown here that the structure of neurofuzzy networks with scatter partitioning can be obtained from the support vectors (SV) of the Support Vector Regression (SVR), since the SVR can be transformed to a neurofuzzy network. The main advantage of this approach is that the structure of the neurofuzzy networks can now be objectively chosen, as the SV are obtained by constrained optimization for a given modelling error bound. Since neurofuzzy networks are linear-inweights networks, the estimate of the weights of the networks can be obtained by the linear least-squares method. The properties of neurofuzzy networks based on the SV are derived, and its performance is illustrated by a simulation example involving a non...\n",

Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array (MEA) technology. Indeed, high-density MEAs provide large-scale covering (several mm²) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50µm) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of MEA-collected data remain limited. Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data. NeuroMap uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any MEA design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D MEA data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid deformation based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data.

This paper introduces a formal characterization of smooth hinge function (SHF), which can be used to generate SHH as a neural network. A method for the general construction of SHF is also given. Furthermore, the work proves that SHH is better than HH in functional approximation, i.e., the optimal error of SHH approximating a general function is always smaller or equal to that of HH. Particularly, in the case that the SHF is generated via the integration of a class of sigmoidal functions, it is further proven that the corresponding SHH of the 2 m  SHFs would outperform a neural network with  m  of the sigmoidal function from which the SHF is derived. Any upper bound established on the approximation error of a neural network of  m  sigmoidal activation functions can hence be translated to the SHH of  m  SHFs by replacing  m  with  m /2. The work also includes an algorithm for the identification of SHH making use of its differentiability property. Simulation experiments are presented to validate the theoretical conclusions to possible extent.\n",

All SLAM algorithms to date can only be applied in one environment at a time. In this paper we propose to extend SLAM to multi-environments. In SmartSLAM, the robot first classifies its entourage using environment recognition code and then performs SLAM using landmarks that are appropriate for its surrounding milieu. One thousand images of various indoor and outdoor environments were collected and used as training data for a three-layered feedforward backpropagation neural network. This neural network was then tested on two sets of query images of indoor environments and another two sets of outdoor environments, yielding 83% and 95% correct classification rates for the indoor images and 80% and 79% success rates for the outdoor images.\n",

For such a task, a learning algorithm is proposed which is based on a variational formulation of Pontryagin's maximum principle. The convergence of this algorithm, under reasonable assumptions, is also investigated. Numerical examples of learning nontrivial two-class problems are presented which demonstrate the efficiency of the approach proposed.\n",

Trajectory analysis is one of the basic problems in behavior understanding, and the learning of trajectory patterns that can be used to detect anomalies and predict object trajectories is an interesting and important problem in trajectory analysis. In this paper, we present a hierarchical self-organizing neural network model and its application to the learning of trajectory distribution patterns for event recognition. The distribution patterns of trajectories are learnt using a hierarchical self-organizing neural network. Using the learned patterns, we consider anomaly detection as well as object behavior prediction. Compared with the existing neural network structures that are used to learn patterns of trajectories, our network structure has smaller scale and faster learning speed, and is thus more effective. Experimental results using two different sets of data demonstrate the accuracy and speed of our hierarchical self-organizing neural network in learning the distribution patterns of object trajectories.\n",

The CRBM is expected to automatically discover common features lurking in time-series data. When we train two CRBMs for a source and target speaker independently using only speaker-dependent training data, it can be considered that each CRBM tries to construct subspaces where there are fewer phonemes and relatively more speaker individuality than the original acoustic space because the training data include various phonemes while keeping the speaker individuality unchanged. Each obtained high-order feature is then concatenated using a neural network (NN) from the source to the target. The entire network (the two CRBMs and the NN) can be also fine-tuned as a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the acoustic parallel data since both the CRBMs and the concatenating NN have network-based representation with time dependencies. Through voice-conversion experiments, we confirmed the high performance of our method especially in terms of objective evaluation, comparing it with conventional GMM, NN, RNN, and our previous work, speaker-dependent DBN approaches.\n",

Because a FBF network is different from other networks in that it is the only one that can combine numerical and linguistic information, comparisons are made when only numerical data is available. In particular, a FBF network is compared with a radial basis function (RBF) network from the viewpoint of function approximation. Their architectural interrelationships are discussed. Additionally, a RBF network, which is implemented using a regularization technique, is compared with a FBF network from the viewpoint of overcoming ill-posed problems. A FBF network is also compared with Specht's probabilistic neural network and his general regression neural network (GRNN) from an architectural point of view.

Texture-analysis methods can be applied to detect clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms. In this paper, a comparative study of texture-analysis methods is performed for the surrounding region-dependence method, which has been proposed by the authors, and conventional texture-analysis methods, such as the spatial gray level dependence method, the gray-level run-length method, and the gray-level difference method. Textural features extracted by these methods are exploited to classify regions of interest (ROI's) into positive ROI's containing clustered microcalcifications and negative ROI's containing normal tissues. A three-layer backpropagation neural network is used as a classifier.

This model is capable of planning real-time robot motion with sudden environmental changes, motion of a car with multiple targets, and motion of multiple robots. The proposed neural network model is biologically inspired, where the dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation. There are only local connections among neurons. The real-time optimal robot motion is planned through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over the free workspace nor the collision paths, without explicitly optimizing any cost functions, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, without any learning process, and without any local collision checking procedures. Therefore it is computationally efficient. The stability of the neural network is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation studies.\n",

The proposed method uses a novel neural network (NN) based robust integral sign of the error (RISE) observer, or estimator, allowing for semi-global asymptotic stability in the presence of NN approximation errors, disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. This is in comparison to typical results presented in the literature that show only boundedness in the presence of uncertainties. The output of the observer/estimator is compared with that of the nonlinear system and a residual is used for declaring the presence of a fault when the residual exceeds a user defined threshold. The NN weights are tuned online with no offline tuning phase. The output of the RISE observer is utilized for diagnostics. Additionally, a method for time-to-failure (TTF) prediction, a first step in prognostics, is developed by projecting the developed parameter-update law under the assumption that the nonlinear system satisfies a linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) assumption. The TTF method uses known critical values of a system to predict when an estimated parameter will reach a known failure threshold. The performance of the NN/RISE observer system is evaluated on a nonlinear system and a simply supported beam finite element analysis (FEA) simulation based on laboratory experiments. Results show that the proposed method provides as much as 25% increased accuracy while the TTF scheme renders a more accurate prediction.\n",

The performance of Pi-Sigma Networks is evaluated through several well known Neural Network Training benchmarks. In the experiments reported here, Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms are implemented for Pi-Sigma neural networks training. More specifically the distributed versions of the Differential Evolution and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms have been employed. To this end, each processor is assigned a subpopulation of potential solutions. The subpopulations are independently evolved in parallel and occasional migration is employed to allow cooperation between them. The proposed approach is applied to train Pi-Sigma Networks using threshold activation functions. Moreover, the weights and biases were confined to a narrow band of integers, constrained in the range [-32,32]. Thus, the trained Pi-Sigma neural networks can be represented by using 6bits. Such networks are better suited than the real weight ones for hardware implementation and to some extend are immune to low amplitude noise that possibly contaminates the training data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed training process is fast, stable and reliable and the distributed trained Pi-Sigma Networks exhibited good generalization capabilities.\n",

For automatic error detection, two problems have to be solved. The accuracy of the measurement system has to be on a sufficient level and the errors have to be detected in the 3D measurement data. The measuring of the surface shape can be done by an optical 3D measurement system. This system consists of two cameras and one projector. The problem of error detection is solved by a method based on neural networks. The measurement data of one or more master workpieces is stored in the weights of a neural network.

These networks incorporate Gaussian synapses and are trained using a specific algorithm called Gaussian synapse back propagation described here. Gaussian synapses present an intrinsic filtering ability that permit concentrating on what is relevant in the spectra and automatically discard what is not. The networks are structurally adapted to the problem complexity as superfluous synapses and/or nodes are implicitly eliminated by the training procedure, thus pruning the network to the required size straight from the training set. The fundamental difference between the present proposal and other ANN topologies using Gaussian functions is that the latter use these functions as activation functions in the nodes, while in our case, they are used as synaptic elements, allowing them to be easily shaped during the training process to produce any type of n-dimensional discriminator. This paper proposes a multi- and hyperspectral image segmenter that results from the parallel and concurrent application of several of these networks providing a probability vector that is processed by a decision module. Depending on the criteria used for the decision module, different perspectives of the same image may be obtained. The resulting structure offers the possibility of resolving mixtures, that is, carrying out a spectral unmixing process in a very straightforward manner.\n",

            "Paper ID: 4b912ab1-ee2a-4a1e-b228-1aa0b27f80ee, Title: Pareto evolutionary neural networks, Abstract: For the purposes of forecasting (or classification) tasks neural networks (NNs) are typically trained with respect to Euclidean distance minimization. This is commonly the case irrespective of any other end user preferences. In a number of situations, most notably time series forecasting, users may have other objectives in addition to Euclidean distance minimization. Recent studies in the NN domain have confronted this problem by propagating a linear sum of errors. However this approach implicitly assumes a priori knowledge of the error surface defined by the problem, which, typically, is not the case. This study constructs a novel methodology for implementing multiobjective optimization within the evolutionary neural network (ENN) domain. This methodology enables the parallel evolution of a population of ENN models which exhibit estimated Pareto optimality with respect to multiple error measures. A new method is derived from this framework, the Pareto evolutionary neural network (Pareto-ENN). The Pareto-ENN evolves a population of models that may be heterogeneous in their topologies inputs and degree of connectivity, and maintains a set of the Pareto optimal ENNs that it discovers. New generalization methods to deal with the unique properties of multiobjective error minimization that are not apparent in the uni-objective case are presented and compared on synthetic data, with a novel method based on bootstrapping of the training data shown to significantly improve generalization ability. Finally experimental evidence is presented in this study demonstrating the general application potential of the framework by generating populations of ENNs for forecasting 37 different international stock indexes.\n",

It allows one person to interact with a humanoid social robot using natural body language. The robot understands the meaning of human upper body gestures and expresses itself by using a combination of body movements, facial expressions, and verbal language. A set of 12 upper body gestures is involved for communication. This set also includes gestures with human—object interactions. The gestures are characterized by head, arm, and hand posture information. The wearable Immersion CyberGlove II is employed to capture the hand posture. This information is combined with the head and arm posture captured from Microsoft Kinect. This is a new sensor solution for human-gesture capture. Based on the posture data from the CyberGlove II and Kinect, an effective and real-time human gesture recognition method is proposed. The gesture understanding approach based on an innovative combination of sensors is the main contribution of this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed gesture recognition method, a human body gesture data set is built. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can recognize the upper body gestures with high accuracy in real time. In addition, for robot motion generation and control, a novel online motion planning method is proposed. In order to generate appropriate dynamic motion, a quadratic programming (QP)-based dual-arms kinematic motion generation scheme is proposed, and a simplified recurrent neural network is employed to solve the QP problem. The integration of a handshake within the HRI system illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed online generation method.\n",

In the problems studied, the function mapped by an ANN changes during the search carried out by the GA. In the GA proposed, each gene is associated with an independent mutation probability. The knowledge obtained during the evolution is used to update the mutation probabilities. If the modification of a set of genes is useful when the problem changes its profile, the mutation probabilities of these genes are increased. As a result, the search is concentrated into regions associated with genes presenting higher mutation probabilities.\n",

A layered perceptron partially trained for binary classification is considered. The single-output neuron is trained to be either a zero or a one. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, one-half. The set of inputs that produce an output of one-half forms the classification boundary. The authors adopted an inversion algorithm for the neural network that allows generation of this boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the steepness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pairs are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and presented to an oracle for proper classification. These data are used to refine further the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points. An application example to power system security assessment is given. >\n",

In the past, Viterbi decoders have usually been implemented using digital circuits. The speed of these digital decoders is directly related to the amount of parallelism in the design. As the constraint length of the code increases, parallelism becomes problematic due to the complexity of the decoder. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) Viterbi decoder is presented. The ANN decoder is significantly faster than comparable digital-only designs due to its fully parallel architecture. The fully parallel structure is obtained by implementing most of the Viterbi algorithm using analog neurons as opposed to digital circuits. Several modifications to the ANN decoder are considered, including an analog/digital hybrid design that results in an extremely fast and efficient decoder. The ANN decoder requires one-sixth the number of transistors required by the digital decoder. The connection weights of the ANN decoder are either +1 or -1, so weight considerations in the implementation are eliminated. This, together with the design's modularity and local connectivity, makes the ANN Viterbi decoder a natural fit for VLSI implementation. Simulation results are provided to show that the performance of the ANN decoder matches that of an ideal Viterbi decoder.\n",

Their data are, therefore, valuable for assimilating into general circulation models of the atmosphere. Direct assimilation of radiances from limb sounders is more complex in practice than from nadir sounders due to the need to know the tangent pressures of the measurements. This paper discusses the practical implications of tangent pressures in direct radiance assimilation of limb sounding radiances and demonstrates that a neural network can be used to find these tangent pressures for the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder with a root mean-square error of sigma=50 m, which is comparable with that in traditional retrieval techniques\n",

The defective regions are usually identified through visual judgment with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Five to ten people visually check wafers and hand-mark their defective regions.

The energy function is used to describe the energy evolution of the neuronal population with time and the coupled relationship between neurons at the subthreshold and the suprathreshold states. The Hamiltonian motion equation with the membrane potential is obtained from the neuroelectrophysiological data contaminated by Gaussian white noise. The results of this research show that the mean membrane potential is the exact solution of the motion equation of the membrane potential developed in a previously published paper. It also shows that the Hamiltonian energy function derived in this brief is not only correct but also effective. Particularly, based on the principle of energy coding, an interesting finding is that in some subsets of neurons, firing action potentials at the suprathreshold and some others simultaneously perform activities at the subthreshold level in neural ensembles. Notably, this kind of coupling has not been found in other models of biological neural networks.\n",

An automated classifier which maps from an input space to one of the likelihood ratio family of decision variables is an optimal classifier or \"ideal observer.\" Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are frequently used as classifiers for many problems. In the limit of large training sample sizes, an ANN approximates a mapping function which is a monotonic transformation of the likelihood ratio, i.e., it estimates an ideal observer decision variable. A principal disadvantage of conventional ANNs is the potential over-parameterization of the mapping function which results in a poor approximation of an optimal mapping function for smaller training samples. Recently, Bayesian methods have been applied to ANNs in order to regularize training to improve the robustness of the classifier. The goal of training a Bayesian ANN with finite sample sizes is, as with unlimited data, to approximate the ideal observer. The authors have evaluated the accuracy of Bayesian ANN models of ideal observer decision variables as a function of the number of hidden units used, the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the number of features or dimensionality of the data. The authors show that when enough training data are present, excess hidden units do not substantially degrade the accuracy of Bayesian ANNs. However, the minimum number of hidden units required to best model the optimal mapping function varies with the complexity of the data.\n",

The nonaffine systems are represented by nonlinear auto regressive moving average with exogenous input (NARMAX) model with unknown nonlinear functions. An equivalent affine-like representation for the tracking error dynamics is developed first from the original nonaffine system. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning-based neural network (NN) controller is proposed for the affine-like nonlinear error dynamic system. The control scheme consists of two NNs. One NN is designated as the critic, which approximates a predefined long-term cost function, whereas an action NN is employed to derive a control signal for the system to track a desired trajectory while minimizing the cost function simultaneously. Offline NN training is not required and online NN weight tuning rules are derived. By using the standard Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is demonstrated.\n",

The aim is to identify an image independently of its rotational orientation and size, as well as changing its color intensity. The current techniques such as high-ordered neural network and Zernike moments are not practical to apply to color images of size at least 256 /spl times/ 256 pixels. This paper introduces a novel recognition system, which has less computational time and space than the current techniques. Most implementations for finding machine classifiers are the multi layer perceptron (MLP) of which drawbacks lead to its costly training time and its slow learning behavior. The proposed system builds the classification function based on the concept of support vector machine (SVM) without kernel function of k-NN, called critical support vector machine (CSVM). CSVM is better generalization ability in terms of accuracy rate and lower complexity in terms of computational time and space. In part of invariance, the paper develops the rotational and scaling invariant self-organizing mapping (RSISOM), which composes the Kohonen's learning concept and principle component analysis. RSISOM can capture the features of color images invariant to rotation, scaling and color intensity. In experiment, the proposed system is tested against different 34 colored images with 98.2 % of the correct classification.\n",

In PRONET approach, CP patterns are extracted from a multiview model of a 3D CAD representation of an object. Correspondences are also saved in the CP pattern. A three-layer feed-forward neural network is trained with these CPs. By matching a CP pattern of the given image with that of the neural network, approximate orientation of the object and line-to-line correspondence between image features and CAD features are obtained. An iterative model posing method then calculates the more exact pose of the object based on initial orientation and correspondence. The advantages of this method are (1) since time-consuming portions of the task are executed off-line, an object can be quickly recognized in the execution stage, and (2) correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features can be quickly obtained by matching a single CP pattern, instead of creating many hypotheses and then trying to verify each, and (3) PRONET is tightly integrated with the CAD system.\n",

Traditionally, clinicians make prognostic decisions based on clinicopathologic markers. However, it is not easy for the most skilful clinician to come out with an accurate prognosis by using these markers alone. Thus, there is a need to use genomic markers to improve the accuracy of prognosis. The main aim of this research is to apply a hybrid of feature selection and machine learning methods in oral cancer prognosis based on the parameters of the correlation of clinicopathologic and genomic markers. Results: In the first stage of this research, five feature selection methods have been proposed and experimented on the oral cancer prognosis dataset. In the second stage, the model with the features selected from each feature selection methods are tested on the proposed classifiers. Four types of classifiers are chosen; these are namely, ANFIS, artificial neural network, support vector machine and logistic regression. A k-fold cross-validation is implemented on all types of classifiers due to the small sample size. The hybrid model of ReliefF-GA-ANFIS with 3-input features of drink, invasion and p63 achieved the best accuracy (accuracy = 93.81%; AUC = 0.90) for the oral cancer prognosis. Conclusions: The results revealed that the prognosis is superior with the presence of both clinicopathologic and genomic markers. The selected features can be investigated further to validate the potential of becoming as significant prognostic signature in the oral cancer studies.\n",

The introduction of QESNs is made possible by the recent emergence of quaternion nonlinear activation functions with local analytic properties, required by nonlinear gradient descent training algorithms. To make QENSs second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), we employ augmented quaternion statistics to introduce widely linear QESNs. To that end, the standard widely linear model is modified so as to suit the properties of dynamical reservoir, typically realized by recurrent neural networks. This allows for a full exploitation of second-order information in the data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances, and a rigorous account of second-order noncircularity (improperness), and the corresponding power mismatch and coupling between the data components. Simulations in the prediction setting on both benchmark circular and noncircular signals and on noncircular real-world 3-D body motion data support the analysis.\n",

The technique is used to demonstrate that a compound's biological binding activity to a receptor can be calculated from the minimum of the square root of the sum of squared deviations (SSSD) of a structurally assigned chemical shift on a template between the unknown compound to be predicted and a set of known compounds with known activities. When building models of biological activity, nonlinear relationships are built into the input training data. If a model is developed by selecting only compounds with minimum structurally assigned chemical shift deviations from the unknown compound, some of the nonlinear relationships can be removed. The smaller the total chemical shift deviation between a compound with known activity and another compound with unknown activity, the more likely it will have similar biological, chemical, and physical properties. This means that a model can be produced without rigorous statistics or neural networks. This technique is similar to structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling, but instead of relying on substructure fragments to produce a model, this new model is based on minimum chemical shift differences on those substructure fragments. We refer to this method as minimum deviation of structurally assigned spectra analysis (MiDSASA) modeling. Modeling by the minimum deviation concept can be applied to other chemoinformatic data analyses such as metabolite concentrations in metabolic pathways for metabolomics research. A MiDSASA template model for 30 steroids binding the corticosterone binding globulin based on the activity factors of the two nearest compounds had a correlation of 0.88.

It is therefore desirable to design such systems automatically, e.g., by utilizing evolutionary algorithms that produce symmetry through developmental mechanisms. The success of these algorithms depends on how well they explore the space of valid symmetries. This paper presents an approach called evolution of network symmetry and modularity (ENSO) that utilizes group theory to search the space of symmetries effectively. This approach was evaluated by evolving neural network controllers for a quadruped robot in physically realistic simulations. On flat ground, the resulting controllers are as fast as those having hand-designed symmetry, and significantly faster than those without symmetry. On inclined ground, where the appropriate symmetries are difficult to determine manually, ENSO produced significantly faster gaits that also generalize better than those of other approaches. On robots with a more complicated structure including knee joints, ENSO resulted in more regular gaits than the other approaches. These results suggest that ENSO is a promising approach for evolving complex systems with modularity and symmetry.\n",

In real-world applications, however, the performance of these neural networks is dynamic regarding the use of different datasets. One of the reasons is that there are some redundant features for the dataset. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose an approach of combining Neural Networks with Random Forest to improve the accuracy of detecting network intrusions. In particular, we design an intelligent anomaly detection system that uses the algorithm of Random Forest in the process of feature selection and selects an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments using the KDD1999 dataset and a real dataset respectively. The experimental results indicate that Random Forest can enhance the performance of Neural Networks by identifying important and closely related features and that our developed system can select a better algorithm intelligently.\n",

In the one-dimensional case, an exact analysis establishes the existence of a limiting distribution that is not Gaussian in general. For the general case and small learning constant, a linearization approximation permits the application of results from the theory of random matrices to again establish the existence of a limiting distribution. We study the first few moments of this distribution to compare and contrast the results of our analysis with those of techniques of stochastic approximation.\n",

In particular, a new fuzzy model, the Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network (DFNN), consisting of recurrent TSK rules, is developed. The premise and defuzzification parts are static while the consequent parts of the fuzzy rules are recurrent neural networks with internal feedback and time delay synapses. The network is trained by means of a novel learning algorithm, named Dynamic-Fuzzy Neural Constrained Optimization Method (D-FUNCOM), based on the concept of constrained optimization. The proposed algorithm is general since it can be applied to locally as well as fully recurrent networks, regardless of their structures. An adaptation mechanism of the maximum parameter change is presented as well. The proposed dynamic model, equipped with the learning algorithm, is applied to several temporal problems, including modeling of a NARMA process and the noise cancellation problem. Performance comparisons are conducted with a series of static and dynamic systems and some existing recurrent fuzzy models. Simulation results show that DFNN compares favorably with its competing rivals and thus it can be considered for efficient system identification.\n",
            "Paper ID: 4c2dc105-2d83-4dc5-a731-8afca159ac58, Title: Evolutionary morphogenesis for multi-cellular systems, Abstract: With a gene required for each phenotypic trait, direct genetic encodings may show poor scalability to increasing phenotype length. Developmental systems may alleviate this problem by providing more efficient indirect genotype to phenotype mappings. A novel classification of multi-cellular developmental systems in evolvable hardware is introduced. It shows a category of developmental systems that up to now has rarely been explored. We argue that this category is where most of the benefits of developmental systems lie (e.g. speed, scalability, robustness, inter-cellular and environmental interactions that allow fault-tolerance or adaptivity). This article describes a very simple genetic encoding and developmental system designed for multi-cellular circuits that belongs to this category. We refer to it as the morphogenetic system. The morphogenetic system is inspired by gene expression and cellular differentiation. It focuses on low computational requirements which allows fast execution and a compact hardware implementation. The morphogenetic system shows better scalability compared to a direct genetic encoding in the evolution of structures of differentiated cells, and its dynamics provides fault-tolerance up to high fault rates. It outperforms a direct genetic encoding when evolving spiking neural networks for pattern recognition and robot navigation. The results obtained with the morphogenetic system indicate that this \"minimalist\" approach to developmental systems merits further study.\n",

For coding, it is important that the input parameters that will be used to define this relationship be able to distinguish between the same shape at different scales, as well as different shapes at the same scale. We consider an MRF model, referred to as the Chien model, which accounts for high-order spatial interactions among pixels. We propose to use the statistical moments of the Chien model as input to a neural network to accurately predict the rate and distortion of the binary shape when coded at various scales.\n",

The proposed neural network consists of four layers - input, hidden, output and final output layers. The hidden and output layers are multiple. Using the proposed SICL(Spread Pattern Information and Cooperative Learning) algorithm, it is possible to learn analog data accurately and to obtain smooth outputs. Using this neural network, we have developed a speech production system consisting of a phonemic symbol production subsystem and a speech parameter production subsystem. We have succeeded in producing natural speech waves with high accuracy.\n",

A commonly investigated problem is how complicated dynamics take place in dynamical systems consisting of (often simple) subsystems. It is shown though numerical experiments that emergent order such as periodic behavior can likely take place in coupled chaotic dynamical systems. This is demonstrated for the particular case of coupled chaotic continuous time Hopfield neural networks. In particular, it is shown that when two chaotic Hopfield neural networks are coupled by simple sigmoid signals, periodic behavior can emerge as a consequence of this coupling.?\n",
